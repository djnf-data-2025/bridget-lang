"1","NEWSWEEK Persp Registered The Cargo Plane by RAYMOND Loos ANGELES—The decision of Donald Nelson to authorize Henry J. Kaiser to build three giant cargo planes in collaboration with Howard Hughes seems to make a good deal of sense. The interest aroused by this news and by the long and informative discussions that preceded it has done a great deal to make people appreciate the value of large cargoflying ships. The experi mental work now authorized will teach us all much that will be useful in the war effort and in transportation after the war. It is obvious that when an entirely new design is contemplated it takes time to produce even experimental models. It is estimated by Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Hughes that the three will not 15 months, the second in 20 months and the third in 25 months. If it is then decided to put them into production, some months must elapse before they roll off the line. The public has been informed from time to time of quite understandable differences of opinion about the feasi bility and desirability of building this type of plane at this time. One of the reasons for misunderstanding has been the fact that ideas as well as specific plans have been continually changing throughout the period of discussion. At all times, many complicated technical problems of management and engineer ing have been involved. After wide discussion in Washington and elsewhere, a meeting was held here about four weeks ago between Mr. a WPB representative and a committee of three leaders in the air plane industry. This committee was acting upon a suggestion of the WPB to talk the matter over with Mr. Kaiser and to report on their findings and con clusions. No specific plan came out of the meeting. This was not because the industry itself was lacking in a desire to cooperate. It is the settled rule in the industry that any manufacturer will make available any plans, engineering ideas, advice and technical personnel at his disposal to any other manufacturer who actually has an order from the government to build planes. At that time Mr. Kaiser had no such order, and there was a good deal of uncertainty as to the plane that was to be built and ro be finished for two years—the first in Kaiser, SEPTEMBER 28, 1942 ective . S. Patent Office Question the organization which was to do the building. In these circumstances, it was urged that Mr. Kaiser give his unquestioned manufacturing ability to the mass pro duction of some model already designed. But it seems that Mr. Kaiser thought it best to build a new plane. Leaders of the industry pointed out the great outlay of time and the requirements of MOLEY and labor needed for the development of an entirely new model. It is said that in the automobile industry a new model takes close to three years from the original idea to mass production. Some thing of the same effort is required in the case of a new plane. To undertake critical materials, engineering personnel mass production of a new plane would draw heavily upon the strained re sources of an already overburdened in dustry. This apparently became clear not only to the industry but to the various authorities in the government. There is no disposition to deny that vastly bigger planes can be built than any that now exist, or to deny that they will fly and that*they will carry a lot of stuff. When a certain manufacturer was asked how big a cargo plane could be built, his answer was: “Just tell me how much land or water is available to take off from or to land in.” Such ques tions as this, as well as the number and type of cargo planes that will be needed, are matters of strategy to be decided by the Army and the Navy. There is no reason now to assume that this war will have to be fought with the exact types of plane already in production. But it does seem likely that whatever is new or startling in the planes that will come off the production line for some time to come will be a modification and improvement of basic designs that now exist. “Leaders in the industry here and elsewhere have been stressing the im portance of carriers for a long time, and point to the number of excellent cargo planes already in production. The cam paign of Mr. Kaiser has heavily under scored their importance. He can have the immense satisfaction of knowing that he has directed the nation’s atten tion to the value of large carriers. Everyone will wish him well in his new project.",1942,"sim_newsweek-us_1942-09-28_20_13.txt"
"2","? NEWSWEEK Perspective U. S, Three Governorships by RAYMOND As we come to midOctober, two political conclusions are clear. One is a drift toward Republican candidates; the other is a prospective small vote. These two signs may or may not have something in common. My impression is that they are not related. The small vote will come from many contributing causes. First, a lot of people are in the Army and Navy. Second, a lot .more are too busy to think about politics. : An election is a sort of little war, and many vote merely to participate in a contest. Now a real war captures the spirit of contention in people. A great many people have moved because of their employment, and while a lot of these still have the technical qualifications for voting, they are in strange surroundings and the normal political pressures on them are gone. Many: thousands have moved from rural districts to cities and know little of urban registration.rules, These perfectly clear causes, , with, a number of additional ones, will account for a light vote. It is unnecessary to characterize it as apathy. The Republican drift is unmistakable (see Periscope Preview) . Vast numbers of people.are. dissatisfied with the con duct of the war at home and abroad. The rubber debacle alone will lose the Administration countless votes. The President’s scolding of farmers has made no new city and labor votes but has lost him thousands in agri cultural regions. The New Deal has led people to expect so much that they tend to blame it for every discomfort. In this off year, gubernatorial cam ‘paigns are indicative of the trend. Within the month I have made some firsthand study in three widely sepa rated states—New York, Kansas and California. In New York, a curious mixup in party behavior is evident already. Bennett, who is a pretty un inspiring candidate despite the popu larity of his manager Farley, is stronger in upstate Republican New York than any candidate in years but weaker in the big city. As things look now, Dewey may come close to the un precedented feat of carrying the city as a Republican. This creates an em barrassment of sorts for both Dewey and Bennett. Dewey cannot attack the Roosevelt Administration vigorously for fear of losing the city. Bennett cannot .

"5","NEWSWEEK Persp ective Registered + Wanted—Two by RAYMOND Both major parties are faced with the job of selecting a new chairman. The Republican National Committee meets on Dec. 7 to choose a successor to Joseph Martin Jr., who has served since 1940. No date has as yet been set for a Democratic Committee meeting, but those who follow politics closely look for its announcement within a month or so, when Edward J. Flynn, the present Democratic chairman, is expected to resign. With the restoration of a close balance in party strength, the choice of a new chairman in each case is not unim portant. In fact, it may provide some clue to the political events of 1944. In the Democratic party the Presi dent will dictate the decision. His problem will be only to make a selection from the rather scanty list of possibili ties. But these facts are, of themselves, meaningful symptoms of the party organization’s state of health. It can hardly be said that there are any active candidates for the chairman’s job in the Democratic party. Post master General Frank Walker might be drafted by the President, but he would _accept only with the greatest reluctance. Leo Crowley, Alien Property Custodian, is most frequently mentioned. Joseph E. Davies, former Ambassador to Moscow, and John W. McCormack, majority leader of the House, are possibilities. None stirs much enthusiasm. It will be many a day before another Farley is found. The bloom is simply off the job. Not much patronage remains to be given out, and the New Deal inner circle provides what political counsel the President needs. The fight for the chairmanship in the Republican party, on the other hand, suggests the vigor of the party’s hopes. So does the fact that so many prospective Presidential candidacies are in evidence. The GOP is feeling the oats of the November victory. Party insiders say the new chairman must be experienced in politics and must come from the Midwest or West. Circum stances may alter these specifications, but now they seem pretty important. Most frequently mentioned is Werner W. Schroeder, national committeeman DECEMBER 7,'""1942 S. Patent Office Chairmen MOLEY of Illinois, who, since 1940, has presided over a sort of renaissance of Republican ism in his state. He is pretty violently opposed by Willkie friends, however, because they say he is too close to the McCormickBrooks people. This opposi tion may turn the choice elsewhere. There is a strong call for Alf M. Landon, who is reluctant to serve. Other possibilities are national committeemen Harrison E. Spangler of Iowa, Ralph H. Cake of Oregon and Sinclair Weeks of Massachusetts. Likewise John Hollister of Ohio, former congressman and law partner of Senator Taft. The chances that the committee will go completely outside the party organization to select some wellknown businessman are ex ceedingly slim. After an insistent demand by Mr. Willkie a statement on foreign affairs was adopted at the April meeting of the Republican National Committee. This time there is little demand for statements of party policy. That is fortunate because the making of any resolution on national policy by the national committee is an impropriety. It has no legal power to bind the party. The convention, does that. The com mittee’s job is to keep the national party alive between Presidential cam paigns, to prepare for the convention and the campaign, to raise money, to conduct research on national affairs and to maintain contact with state and local organizations. Mr. Willkie’s influence in the forth coming meeting will be of some im portance. But it will not be decisive. The 1940 candidate will, it is said, con trol not over a quarter of the 106 members. The rift between him and the ‘ party organization is now pretty deep. But arguments among Republicans, while troublesome, are not signs of weakness. In 1920 the Republican party emerged from years of internal conflict to win the election. In 19382, though the preconvention fight of the Democrats was bitter, they carried through tri umphantly. The real test of the Re publican party will be the performance of its 22 governors, it 209 members of the House and its $8 senators, not what its members say about each other.",1942,"sim_newsweek-us_1942-12-07_20_23.txt"

"286","The current optimism of Democrats as they look toward 1948 seems to be based on polls showing a rise in Truman's popularity. That rise is no doubt due to his firm stand against John L. Lewis; to the excellence of some of his appointments; to his steady following of a fairly conservative line in domestic affairs; and to his generally dignified and modest air as he goes about his business. Truman has, it is clear, won a more friendly attitude among middleoftheroad people, many of whom voted Republican last November.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-06-09_29_23.txt"

"288","But a Presidential election is decided on broad and deep political currents. This is shown in an analysis of Roosevelt's four victories. In 1932, we were sunk in a depression, and Roosevelt's farm program won many normally Republican states. In 1936, Roosevelt was riding the crest of a genuine business upturn. In 1940 and 1944, the decisive factors were the war and the votes of the big cities.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-06-09_29_23.txt"

"290","From 1936 to 1944, city majorities greatly increased, while Democratic strength ebbed in the counties of nearly every state. For example, in Illinois Roosevelt carried 71 counties in 1936; 29 in 1940; and only 17 in 1944. In Ohio, he carried 67 in 1936; 28 in 1940; and 14 in 1944. In Pennsylvania he carried 41 in 1936; 25 in 1940; and 16 in 1944. In Truman's home state, Missouri, Roosevelt carried 74 counties in 1936; 49 in 1940; and 43 in 1944.

"292","Therefore, unless Truman can convince people that an international crisis requires his reelection and unless he turns the tide in the rural districts and small towns, he is not likely to be reelected in 1948 against any of three or four of the stronger Republican possibilities. For it is not at all certain that the approval which he is enjoying will be expressed in votes.

"294","This point gathers strength when one considers that on the two domestic issues which most concern farmers, businessmen and small town citizens—labor and finance—the Republican record will be most attractive. The Republicans will produce a labor bill and a big cut in the budget. In the nature of things, Truman must oppose these pieces of legislation. My guess is that he will veto a Taftlike labor bill only if he knows that Congress will override him. He would court disaster if he killed all hope for labor reform, but he must make a gesture toward labor. On tax and budget cuts, he is on record against the Republican position.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-06-09_29_23.txt"

In the cities which Roosevelt counted on for huge majorities, the omens are not good for Democrats. There is, under the surface, definite division in the labor rank and file. That appeared in the 1946 vote. The piebald maverick contingent—the Wallacites, the Ickesenians, the citizens' committees and so forth—are running in all directions—where only Providence knows, but certainly not toward Democratic club houses.

Shutting them out of Britain means a loss to the American industry of all the profits formerly counted on from there. There are various estimates of the net yearly profit to American companies from films shown in Great Britain. The figure is probably more than $40,000,000. This conservative estimate is about onequarter of the profits of all American companies.

Not much relief can be expected from raising admission prices in American theaters, because ever since the end of the war there has been stiff resistance by theatergoers to what are widely considered top prices for secondrate pictures. Little relief is expected through an escape from the star system, because the American public demands stars and neglects pictures which try to get by on merit. While there is some griping here about recent agreements to exhibit British pictures in the United States, the present situation has little to do with British importations. J. Arthur Rank has concluded a deal which permits him to exhibit some of his pictures in American theaters. But the prospective profit of $12,000,000 is an inconsiderable offset to the amount American pictures earn in Britain, and Rank himself is seriously injured by his government's action, because of his vast ownership of British theaters.

"794","It is the Odyssey of a man who has spent 50 exciting years in the stormy waters of politics. Unlike Steffens, who always held to the detachment of a journalist, Creel from time to time was led by his intense feelings to plunge into the middle of the battle. He served as police commissioner in a reform regime in Denver, as Wilson's chairman of the Committee on Public Information in the World War; held office in the NRA and WPA in New Deal days; and ran against Upton Sinclair in the gubernatorial primary in California.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-12-15_30_24.txt"

"796","As participant or journalist, Creel turned up wherever things were happening in this momentous halfcentury. Vivid and often extremely amusing pictures emerge from his pacemaking prose: Kansas City at the height and worst of the Pendergast regime, Denver with Tammen and Bonfils and Patterson, Wilson days in Washington, primitive Hollywood, Washington in the early New Deal days, and California when bizarre Utopianism burgeoned in the 30s.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-12-15_30_24.txt"

"798","The serious historian cannot overlook Creel's articles in Collier's during F.D.R.'s first and second terms, for he had easy access to the President and, in many cases, Creel was writing what the President was thinking. Some of his pieces were authentic trial balloons. Creel's judgment of Woodrow Wilson is kindly but judicial. He worshipped the breadth of Wilson's vision but lamented the blunders and prejudices which frustrated the peace. The Creel appraisal of Colonel House is etched in bitter lines. Creel reserves judgment on Truman, but he inexorably sets forth the President's Pendergast antecedents.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-12-15_30_24.txt"

"800","ARDENT worshippers will not enjoy the Creel appraisal of F.D.R., but the pattern of his disillusionment is not unlike that of many early New Dealers. He was thrilled by the 1933 promise, disconcerted by the ragtag California supporters of Roosevelt in 1934, shocked by the Roosevelt who made the Court fight of 1937, frightened by the attempted purge of 1938. The final Creel judgment is that F.D.R. dissipated a great liberal movement by failure to complete what was started and that, under the influence of power and public acclaim, he developed a complex of infallibility.",1947,"sim_newsweek-us_1947-12-15_30_24.txt"

"802","The wild oats of New Dealism in California grew in the form of many radical movements. The mumbojumbo rituals of the Utopians, the weird economics of Upton Sinclair's productionforuse and the unprincipled exploitation of the old and guileless by the Townsend movement are all dissected by Creel in unforgettable terms. I do not want to put words in the mouth of my witness, but I strongly feel that the implication of Creel's story of 50 years is that the problems as well as the remedies of the Progressive Era of 40 years ago are as dead as Nineveh and Tyre. Whether the remedies proposed by Progressives were effective or whether the patient recovered naturally, we cannot know. That there have been gains is indisputable. Business, which now ""operates in a shop window,"" has a sense of trusteeship unknown in 1900. There will probably never be another Tweed.

The direct primary, initiative, referendum and recall and other gadgets failed to meet the hopes of 40 years ago. Devices to improve city government, such as commission government and the citymanager plan, were temporarily useful. But corrupt politics generally succeeded in controlling these systems as adequately as it controlled mayors and councils.

The CIO, which certainly would seek the brightest view of Congressional sentiment, confesses that at least sixteen representatives and eight senators ""must be persuaded"" to repudiate their past record, if the TaftHartley Act is to be repealed. A CIO analysis points out that 227 congressmen and 50 senators who voted for the TaftHartley bill are now in office. It points out, in addition, that six new congressmen and two new senators won against labor opposition and that four new senators voted TaftHartley as representatives. Thus, in the view of the CIO, 233 congressmen and 56 senators, a comfortable majority, stand against the present bill.

Money in the form of dues can be collected from members and used in political activity with precious little responsibility. Union members are thus locked into support of the Administration. Presumably, since this is an agreement among politicians who have a rough code of fair play, union chiefs can be counted on or at least expected to refrain from rocking the Administration's boat by threats embarrassing to the President.

The money thus exacted from the taxpayer would largely be sterilized so far as purchasing power and risk capital are concerned.

"978","A major factor in Dewey's proposals would also be seriously deflationary. This requires a bit of explanation, too. During the war years New York, like other states, acquired a large treasury surplus, which Dewey wisely prevailed upon the legislature to set up as a postwar reconstruction fund. A part of this fund has been spent, but the remainder is about $340,000,000, of which over $200,000,000 is not under contract or planned for any specific use. In his current budget Dewey asks that something more than $70,000,000 from increased taxes be added to this fund. This would be put away for some future use not yet determined. In all, he proposes a tax increase of $168,000,000, a dreary burden on the taxpayers of a state which also bears a heavy proportion of Federal taxes.",1949,"sim_newsweek-us_1949-03-14_33_11.txt"

These DeweyTruman adventures in sterilization would have been wise two or three years ago. But today every economic index shows that the country has passed the inflationary peak, that the boom is leveling off, and that some deflation is in prospect. Therefore, these joint DeweyTruman blows would accelerate the rate of decline to an extent which no one can now determine.",1949,"sim_newsweek-us_1949-03-14_33_11.txt"

Prudent government policy would embody the elimination of waste, the encouragement of venture capital, and, at a moment like this, with so much uncertainty beclouding the future, a measurable assurance that there would be no increase in the tax burden. Individual planning for the future cannot exist when government takes the means of spending and investment into its own hands. Both Truman and Dewey are taking the Papaknowsbest attitude.

Although he touched political life in a very practical way, his lessons for us are largely inferential. In the realm of philosophic speculation, he seems to have found guidance in Spinoza, whose philosophy of politics was more or less systematic. Goethe drew most of his generalizations from that source. Like Spinoza, he believed in authority. But while Spinoza leaned toward the rule of an aristocracy, rather than of a monarch, Goethe seems to have preferred the latter. Perhaps this was because he found in Weimar great encouragement for cultural growth under a benign ruler. Perhaps his expressed views were somewhat influenced by tact toward his patron. And no doubt his disillusionment after the excesses of the French Revolution inclined him toward a ruler. He greatly admired Napoleon.",1949,"sim_newsweek-us_1949-07-18_34_3.txt"

Interminable direction inquiries are eliminated by informative signs and good free maps. Better policing, safety education, and the bitter lessons of experience have impressed upon drivers the common sense of reasonable speed.

The most significant of these trends has been a disposition by a majority of the court, of which Justice Black has been the most definitive spokesman, to reconstruct the constitutional rights of man—life, liberty, and property—in an order of descending importance. ""In short,"" says Freund, ""when freedom of the mind is imperiled by law, it is freedom that commands a momentum of respect; when property is imperiled, it is the lawmakers' judgment that commands respect.""

In 1938, against the President's vigorous opposition, it was substantially repealed. Roosevelt then turned to the sleeping Section 102. Under this law, the Treasury, not the business concerned, decides how much a company should withhold from stockholders and keep as a reserve against future needs and emergencies. The people who make this decision are not the people who have made and live with the business, but are revenue officers without business experience generally and altogether without knowledge of the specific business involved.

It represents the ability to pay labor, buy raw materials, restore machinery and equipment, and provide security for business credit. It becomes the central power plant which supplies jobs, purchasing power, improved products, and a better standard of living for all. To build up strong and productive companies means more income for normal taxation and larger revenues for government. But to compel this security to be dissipated in dividends produces an insignificant amount of tax revenue. The wide scattering of share holdings, in which 80 per cent of stocks are in the hands of relatively small taxpayers, provides a very limited tax source.

"1743","In a spendthrift Administration, the U.S. Treasury has a heavy cross to bear. It must sell government bonds which must be bought on the strange principle that things must or should be quite different from what they really are. Unlike other departments of the government, which enjoy the exhilarating experience of giving something for nothing, the Treasury must induce people to give something and receive less in return. Apparently, the Treasury has decided to be perfectly frank about this, and after granting the bitter truth about savings bonds, sell them for reasons other than for a profitable investment. One proof of this is contained in the reprint of a very blunt speech by a hardhitting banker, Mr. Reno Odlin, president of the Puget Sound National Bank of Tacoma, Wash. Mr. Odlin made his speech at a conference of bankers called by Secretary Snyder last April. Apparently it has been printed through the orders of the Treasury. It does not bear the direct imprimatur of the Treasury, but it carries the label of the Government Printing Office and has been handed out by Treasury people.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1744","",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1745","Mr. Odlin comes immediately to the grim fact that more and more people are asking why they should lend money to a government that has shown an incurable trend toward extravagance and waste. They are asking, further, why in the face of inflation they should lend 1950 dollars, with the prospect of receiving, after ten years, dollars that ""act like quarters or even worse."" Mr. Odlin goes on to say that government should cut expenditures (presumably for civil functions) ""not three or four billion, but several billion of expenditures every year.""",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1746","",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1747","Nevertheless, Mr. Odlin favors the continuation and support of bondsale drives for several reasons, some of which, it should be noted, are reasons beneficial to the country as a whole rather than to the investor. The first reason is that continued investment in savings bonds will ease the urgent problems of the Treasury. The second is that it will encourage the habit of thrift. The third is that buying bonds will increase the interest of the buyer in his government. A fourth is that the American people are ""economic illiterates"" and could scarcely find better ways to invest their money. Finally, this plainspoken man states a great truth and illustrates it with a story. The truth is that when the public buys bonds it checks inflation. When banks buy the bonds, they increase inflation. In short, the public is put on notice that if it withholds money from the government, it will eventually pay in higher prices. Because the government will get the money by borrowing from the banks ""and to the extent that it does so finance its requirements, you have additional inflation in the money supply.""",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1748","",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1749","One man, says Mr. Odlin, asked another why not ""refuse to dig down?"" In other words, if ""your wife is a spendthrift, you just don't give her any more money."" The answer was: ""But what if she has a charge account at every store in town?""",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1750","",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1751","Mr. Odlin has some sharp words for people who favor economy in everything but those projects in which they have a selfish interest, notably ""Chambers of Commerce who have the nerve to pass a resolution at ten minutes after eleven demanding an end to deficit spending and then at thirteen after eleven pass a resolution demanding millions and millions of dollars for some pet local project."" The big punch in Mr. Odlin's speech is this advice to citizens in general: ""...the prevention of further decline in your dollars also is in your hands at the ballot box. You can quit electing spendthrifts to Congress.""",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1752","",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"
"1753","The Treasury deserves a lot of credit for giving currency to this common sense. It ought to order several more millions of this speech to be printed at once and scattered far and wide. For the best hedge for the citizen this fall is to defeat congressmen and senators who have been servile rubber stamps for the most expensive Administration in history. And the best protection for present and past buyers of bonds is to elect congressmen and senators who will protect the credit of the nation.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-09-25_36_13.txt"

He is protesting over and over that he opposes socialized medicine. This, however, is a late conversion, induced, it is said, by the vigor with which Illinois doctors and dentists are learning the ways of politics. Lucas is also denying that he has any sympathy for the plan of his fellow Democrat, Brannan. Also, he announces that he disagrees with Truman's objection to the Communist control act. On TaftHartley, he has what might be called a bifocal record. He voted for the bill and then voted to sustain Truman's veto of the bill.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-10-23_36_17.txt"

"1774","Everett McKinley Dirksen served in Congress from 1933 to 1948, when he retired because of an eye ailment, from which he has since recovered. He had the genuine respect there of members of both parties. His knowledge of the workings of the Federal government is unusual, and his capacity to discuss issues, foreign and domestic, is well up to senatorial standards. This year he has made an almost unprecedented record in campaigning—not only in covering territory, but in the variety of issues he has touched upon. In the main, his target is Truman's foreign policy, but his treatments of farm policy, spending, and the trend to socialism, although secondary, have been important. The wholesome respect with which Lucas regards Dirksen's capacity is shown by a consistent refusal by the Democratic candidate to accept a challenge to debate. There is little evidence of opulence in Dirksen's organization.

"1778","Dan (Tubbo) Gilbert, chief investigator for the State's Attorney for eighteen years, is running on the Democratic ticket for sheriff. The light has been turned on him. He is called the ""richest cop in America,"" and since his job has been to uncover murder mysteries, he is being asked why there have been 1,038 unsolved murders during his tenure of office. Of these, 187 have been gang or racket murders. And the rackets still exist. Even The SunTimes, hitherto a supporter of all and sundry Democrats, asks for the defeat of Gilbert. Between now and next month's election, some very explosive and embarrassing revelations may take place in the crime situation.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-10-23_36_17.txt"

"1780","There are some people who say that the election of Dirksen will depend upon the extent to which vote stealing will be kept at a low figure. Others see a Lucas advantage in piping prosperity throughout the state. My conclusion is that if the normal pre1948 Republican vote and the independent Democrats who are tired of Chicago rackets and Washington blunders turn out on Election Day, the Senate will lose its majority leader. In short, in Illinois as in Ohio, it is up to the people who believe in men like Taft and Dirksen to turn out on Election Day.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-10-23_36_17.txt"

"1790","THE great skill of the British through their government, their press, their universities and other cultural agencies in what may be called international public relations is proverbial. They accomplish with seemingly small effort and material outlay much more than we do with all the millions that we spend in our many friendship organizations. It has always seemed second nature to them to understand the temper of another country and make the most of what they want that country to think, believe, and finally to do.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-11-27_36_22.txt"

"1792","In two wars the capacity of the British to persuade us of the virtue of their position in part, at least, has been the cause why we have, despite our traditional detachment, entered those conflicts with all that we had. There were reasons beyond immediate persuasion for our intervention, such as our community of language, free institutions, commercial intercourse, and pure selfdefense. But the capacity of British statesmen and other leaders in moments of great crisis to say the right and friendly thing has been magnificent.",1950,"sim_newsweek-us_1950-11-27_36_22.txt"

For many months, the American correspondence for the otherwise excellent weekly, The Economist, has been on a veritable antiTaft, antiRepublican, proState Department crusade. This went so far that anyone reading that journal without other information would have been led to believe that Taft and other Midwestern and Western Republicans were misrepresenting the great majority of Americans.

Perhaps this correspondent was leaning too heavily upon some of our own Eastern reporters and sections of our Eastern press.

This word, being a survival of prewar days, is wholly inadequate to describe the attitude of people like Taft, Dirksen, and Nixon, to mention only a sample.

When they become policymakers in the government of the United States, however, their ideas become a matter of public concern, in this case of great concern. Slichter's generality seems to have been based upon a curious book, ""The Effects of Taxation on Executives,"" by Thomas H. Sanders, also a Harvard Business School professor. It was edited by Dan Throop Smith, a professor on leave, who, when appointed to serve with Under Secretary Marion B.

"2095","I would add to Wright's criticism two further observations. The first is that this school of economists seem to have revived a myth which they, of all people, have always labored to dissipate—the ""economic man."" They have created a new economic man—this time, ""the businessman,"" and have tried to put an abstraction into material form. Who knows what predominates in the mass of impulses that drives him to scorn delights and live laborious days?

Now comes a new use. It is to make men work! Material profit may not be the sole motive that moves us.

"2222","This most important part of the Bricker proposal is Section 3, which brings within the regulatory power of Congress the making of executive agreements by more or less anonymous bureaucrats throughout the vast ramifications of the Foreign Service. Most of these agreements originate in international commissions and operate with little notice and no control by Congress. They are a relatively new element in foreign affairs, and, what is most serious, they frequently deal with the internal affairs of the country. Here is a brief sketch of such an operation. In December 1950 Socialist Prime Minister Attlee visited Washington and suggested the creation of an international operation to allocate and distribute raw materials on an international basis. A month later, the State Department announced the creation of such an apparatus, the International Materials Conference, with offices in the department and largely paid for with American money. There was established a “Central Group,” composed of the U.S., the United Kingdom, and France. Then seven committees were formed to allocate and control the price of certain raw materials. The international semantics by which this was designated, “entitlement for consumption,” is, in Marxese, “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.” The IMC made clear the responsibility of each country “for seeing that their allocations are not exceeded.” In January 1952 Assistant Secretary of State Jack McFall said that there was “no statutory authority for the participation of the U.S. in this conference as it is one of many activities carried out in furtherance of the foreign policy of the U.S.”",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"
"2223","",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"
"2224","After the committees made all the decisions, they were enforced in the United States by the extraordinary powers of our various emergency agencies. The National Production Administration distributed tickets which totaled the U.S. “entitlement” to American consumers of copper. Price controls were used in the case of zinc. The OPS prohibited the purchase of zinc processed “from foreign raw materials at a delivered cost above the ceiling price established herein.” The powers of the Defense Production Act were used to limit domestic consumption of sulphur, so as to have a surplus for our friends abroad. Thus, the State Department sponsored and brought about within our domestic economy what really amounted to an international cartel.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"
"2225","",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"
"2226","In fact, in hearings before Congressional committees and in debates it was made clear that Congress did not dream of such an agency as the IMC when it passed emergency legislation. Congress had charged the Munitions Board with the responsibility of accumulating a stockpile of strategic and critical materials. The IMC curtailed that stockpiling at a time when our forces were in a desperate crisis in Korea. In the absence of the emergency agencies which were used in this case, the same thing could be done, even more effectively through executive agreements. This process of bypassing Congress stems from a deepseated feeling by the bureaucratic elite that the public and its representatives are incapable of understanding the high ideals and fine thinking that prevail in international intercourse. Consider these notable last words of the maestro of the elite, Dean Acheson, addressed to the Foreign Service Association a year ago: “Make no mistake, there is a real battle with Congress. There is a great lag in the education and information between you who know the outside world and the great mass of the American people and their elected representatives. A great lag between you who know the facts of life,” etc.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"

"2228","Acheson is gone, but most of the old State Department participants in IMC are still around and appeared before Senator Malone’s subcommittee this month. The Central Group was officially terminated on Dec. 31 last, but its members have indicated their readiness “to consult among themselves.” No wonder those who favor this bypassing of Congress are so fearful of Section 3 of the Bricker amendment.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-02-01_43_5.txt"

That would be enough to run the Federal government something less than four weeks in the coming fiscal year. There is relatively little left up there. Hazlitt also makes the point that the George proposals to raise the exemptions would relieve from four to eight million Americans of all Federal income taxes. Thus we create a society in which some support others. This involves a concept abhorrent to free men.

This would be a real help to a taxpayer in the lower brackets.

"2458","DURING the past few weeks I have attempted in this space to draw attention to a number of legislative proposals which, in the midst of the Donnybrook over who'sthebiggestliarinWashington, may well be rushed through under the pressure of special interests of the Federal bureaucracy and of members of Congress with an eye on elections. Such unwatched pieces of legislation may in the long run be vastly more important than the issues involved in the big fight. The one to which I call attention this week is embodied in two identical bills, H.R. 6788 and S. 2549, introduced by Messrs. Hope and Aiken respectively. This proposal is in the interest of ""soil conservation and other purposes"" and would put the Department of Agriculture substantially in the business of building dams of various sizes in the upper ranges of river basins. Thus there would be launched, in a field already occupied by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation, a third highly competitive agency. In the past, competition between the former two has been deplorable. Both have powerful connections with regional interests such as chambers of commerce, farm groups, and the like. Both are adept at creating pressure on Congress from back home. It should be said on the side of the Department of Agriculture that its soilconservation activities have in the main been constructive and, by comparison with other aids to farmers, relatively economical. Under existing law and Congressional appropriations, the department has been conducting soilconservation and floodprevention operations, including the building of dams running in size all the way from those necessary for ordinary farm ponds to fairly large ones from 50 to 70 feet in height. The point made by those opposing an extension of this work is that dams as large as the latter will, in the great numbers now planned by the department, require a very large engineering and construction agency rivaling those of the Engineers and the Reclamation Bureau. Also, since flood control is one of the purposes of this construction, the Agriculture Department is put into sharp competition with the Army Engineers. Therefore the Engineers moved to the attack before the Senate committee, armed with a long letter from Secretary Stevens and a lengthy statement by the chief of the Engineers. Since the Engineers Corps is a party of interest, I shall not adopt their arguments here, but rather those of independent engineers of high standing. Those engineers say that this plan would create another very large competing agency in a field already crowded; that it would federalize the building of projects which should be undertaken by local interests; that it would make unnecessary Congressional authorization for projects of large magnitude; that it seriously confuses the purposes of soil conservation and flood control and thus makes it impossible to determine benefits and the allocation of costs; and that it would jeopardize the Federal investment by turning the operation of these works over to local interests. Finally, it would create an enormous pork barrel which, under a politically minded Secretary of Agriculture, would have incalculable political potency. The Hope bill, however, has passed the House, and the Aiken bill is now before the Senate committee. Meanwhile, no doubt moved by the great protest against the Upper Colorado storage project and the Army Engineers' campaign against the measure described above, the President, appropriately expressing ""a horror of piecemeal legislation,"" has created a Cabinet Committee on Water Resources Policy, composed of the Secretaries of Interior, Defense, and Agriculture. Wisely he has reminded this committee to cooperate with the Hoover commission, which is reviewing the whole problem under distinguished and competent leadership. IT WOULD be the part of wisdom for Congress to await the report of that committee and the Hoover report before enacting any of the large innovations in water conservation, soil conservation, or reclamation.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-06-14_43_24.txt"

"2469","The late Robert M. La Follette over a period of more than twenty years was one of the most industrious and sincere members of the Senate. His crowning legislative achievement was his cosponsorship of the La FolletteMonroney Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. In that same year he was defeated in the primaries by Joseph McCarthy. It is an ironical footnote to the history of these times not only that La Follette's defeat gave McCarthy his seat in the Senate, but that an item in the Reorganization Act has given his successor his great power as chairman of the Committee on Government Operations. It is naive for Senator Flanders and others to expect—if they do expect—that the Senate will take any action to remove a committee chairman in the course of a session of Congress. Such an action, senators of both parties believe, would mean parliamentary chaos and party irresponsibility. But the Senate itself caused this situation by creating a committee without clearly defined limits of authority.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-07-05_44_1.txt"

"2471","La Follette and the coauthor of the Reorganization Act, Representative and now Sen. A.S. Mike Monroney, created a plan by which many Senate and House committees were consolidated and reduced in number. In the Senate, 38 committees were reduced to fifteen. In the approved reorganization, several of the small and relatively unimportant committees of the Senate were consolidated in a Committee on Expenditures in the executive departments. That committee was later renamed Committee on Government Operations. It was thought by the authors of the plan and by some of the academic people who had been advocating such a reform for years that this would not be a general investigating committee, but a catchall committee, picking up here and there items too small for the busy committees dealing with major departments of the government. Before McCarthy took over, the several chairmen kept to that routine job. But only the faith and trust of a hopeless theoretician would expect that when the lid is left off the oats box a hungry horse will refrain from thrusting its nozzle therein. McCarthy has done exactly what any resourceful and zealous chairman would do with such generalized powers. For almost everything in government involves expenditures. And during the burgeoning of the great Federal bureaucracy during and after the war, it seems to have been possible for Communists and their friends to get into almost every vital department and bureau. Consequently the range of the committee's operations has been very wide.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-07-05_44_1.txt"

"2473","In an effort to limit the McCarthy committee, Senator Monroney in 1953 introduced a resolution which, if passed, would amend the rules of the Senate with the following language: ""In any case in which a controversy arises as to the jurisdiction of any committee of the Senate to make any inquiry or investigation, the question of jurisdiction shall be decided by the Presiding Officer of the Senate, without debate, upon a motion to discharge the committee from further pursuing such inquiry or investigation; but such decision shall be subject to an appeal [to the entire Senate]. The chairman of each committee shall from time to time and at the earliest date practicable report to the Senate the general nature of inquiries or investigations the committee proposes to undertake, or, in any case he deems the national security might be endangered by such report he shall in writing advise the President of the Senate of that fact."" Such a rule would, Senator Monroney believes, make the Senate master of its investigations, as well as of its legislative activity. This resolution is now locked up in the Rules Committee, where it is likely to remain for the rest of the session.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-07-05_44_1.txt"

"2475","It would seem that even with such a rule it would be difficult this year to induce a Senate chairman, say Senator Saltonstall in the case of Army matters, to claim a violation of jurisdiction. And so the problem created by the Senate when it established the Committee on Government Operations remains a problem with no solution in sight.

"2507","FROM time to time over the past few years I have offered in this magazine various discourses, critical in nature, on some of the vast reclamation and power projects before Congress. During the past five months I have devoted a number of pieces to two glaring examples of uneconomic spending proposals, the Fryingpan transmountain diversion in Colorado and the Upper Colorado storage project. The ultimate cost of these two alone, if built, would be well up in the billions. It is a matter of some comfort to me to report that both of these proposals died in the session just ended. In the moment of relief thus afforded, let us ruminate a bit on the ways of politicians and bureaucrats. For both were involved in these projects—the first, to win elections, and the second, to consolidate themselves in government. While we are at it, let us see what can be done when these projects appear again. For the last pitiful outcry of the Senatorial sponsors was that they would return next year.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-09-13_44_11.txt"

"2509","The Fryingpan project reached the floor of the House and was defeated, 195 to 188. For their part in the brief debate that preceded the vote, taxpayers’ thanks are chiefly due to Congressmen Saylor of Pennsylvania, Smith of Virginia, Madden of Indiana, Yorty of California, and Donovan of New York. There were curious things about the vote which can be clarified only by a consideration of the ways of parliamentary logrolling and mutual backscratching. One hundred thirtyfour Democrats and 61 Republicans voted “No.” One hundred thirtyeight Republicans and 50 Democrats voted “Yes.” Many of the Republicans voting “Yes” were from the vicinity of the Great Lakes. The Republican House leadership put the pressure on to keep them in line. What can these people in the Great Lakes region have in common with the needs of the Arkansas Valley in Colorado? Could the earlier vote on the St. Lawrence Seaway have anything to do with it? And why should the party which cried out about Truman extravagances now be the party of the open hand? Can the precarious state of the Colorado election be involved?",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-09-13_44_11.txt"

"2511","The parliamentary history of the huge Upper Colorado project could be a classic story of porkbarrel legislation. The bill came to the Senate committee with a price tag of less than a billion dollars. It came out of that committee enlarged to $1.6 billion. Immensely expensive projects, previously rejected by the President and never approved by the Budget Bureau, were tossed in with reckless abandon. Only two members of that committee, Smathers and Clements, come from east of the Mississippi. And only Kuchel of California opposed it. Kuchel’s opposition was expressed in a most devastating report and statement. The bill was laid aside in the rush at the session’s end, and the companion House bill died in the Rules Committee. There is now barely time for a report by the Hoover commission on the general subject of reclamation, which has for years been in need of a general overhauling. The plain fact is that for the most part irrigation, at present costs and under modern conditions, when applied to arid and semiarid regions is a fantastically expensive way to raise food and fiber. With a few notable exceptions, the projects financed by the Federal government since it went into the business in 1902 have been either failures or most expensive luxuries at Federal expense.",1954,"sim_newsweek-us_1954-09-13_44_11.txt"

It is not especially relevant to note that on the issues which created their opposition—namely, the American colonies and Ireland—Burke was proved to be magnificently correct. More relevant it is that in a speech he made before the election he said that, while the member owed much to his constituents, he must put the national interest over their selfish interests, and that only through strong national parties could freedom be sustained. These two principles are definitely established in British politics.

"2721","**Electoral Lubricant:** The Conservative agent there is Brig. J.A. Mellsop, who retired from the regular army after twenty years' service. He is responsible not strictly to the member from Chippenham, but to the head office of the party in London. During the campaign he has five or six paid employees, but most of his department heads and a great many workers are volunteers. Everything is governed by written orders from Mellsop. His area of operation comprises 90 voting districts, and he must create and energize a committee with a chairman and volunteer workers in each. These distribute and mail party literature, but their most important task is the canvass, the basic element in an election campaign. Workers carry with them lists of the qualified voters and after an interview register thereon the preference of the voter. Early in the campaign, those who will need to vote by mail are identified. If they are Conservative, it is the job of the agent to see that they file the necessary paper for a ballot. On election day the Mellsop organization must see to it that every Conservative in the constituency votes. Mellsop must also schedule six or eight daily appearances of his candidate at designated spots and an equal number for the candidate's wife. The Chippenham member is Sir David Eccles, Minister of Education. The brigadier only has $2,400 to spend in the campaign.",1955,"sim_newsweek-us_1955-05-30_45_22.txt"

And the difficulty of recruiting party members outside the unions is shown by the fact that while 140,000 votes were cast here in 1951 for Labor candidates, there are only 8,000 additional party members.

"2742","In the middle of the nineteenth century the present Conservative Party was created out of the disintegrating fragments of Toryism by the supreme genius of one man, Benjamin Disraeli. This is the more remarkable when it is considered that this man came from neither of the great ruling interests of the time—the mercantile class, which owned the new machines, or the landed aristocracy, which held a monopoly of titles and privileges. Disraeli had to contend against a widespread belief that he was a poseur, a parvenu, and a thoroughly unreliable politician. He also suffered from the prevailing prejudices against the religion of his fathers.",1955,"sim_newsweek-us_1955-06-13_45_24.txt"

"2744","In building his party policies, he appealed over both of the interests I have mentioned to a supreme national interest, symbolized in the Crown and the Empire and which at least should have its representation in the whole of Parliament. Behind the institutions of the Crown and the Empire he sought to array the massive strength of awakening masses of workers, both on the land and in the mills. This he accomplished by sponsoring a series of longneeded social reforms. He invented what he called a ""Tory democracy,"" the prototype of what the Conservative Party now calls a ""propertyowning democracy.""",1955,"sim_newsweek-us_1955-06-13_45_24.txt"

Both of these pleas for political and social justice were published years before Karl Marx wrote ""Das Kapital"" and decades before the origin of modern British socialism in the Fabian Society. Once vested with power at the head of a ruling party, Disraeli secured the enactment of legislation designed to protect the health and safety of the working man, to protect the farmer and farm labor, to clear out slums, to curb land monopoly, to improve the lot of seamen, to protect investors and the savings of the poor, and to enlarge the suffrage.

On the other hand, true masters of politics design political activity—all the printing and oratory, all the piety and wit—to inspire party members with confidence and to stir the sympathetic but lazy to get out and vote. strategy—very days with people who, while paying lip service to the President, would at tack the Republican Party—assumes that there is a fixed number of Demo crats and Republicans, with a decisive minority of socalled independents. The conclusion that they would have us draw is that the only way a candi date on the Republican ticket can win is to look so much and talk so much like a “liberal” Democrat that voters will switch sides and elect him. This concept I have called “the myth of a static electorate.” The fallacy behind it is the idea that political action is concerned with INDEPENDENTS SCORNED The late Ed Flynn of the Bronx, up to the end F.D.R.’s most intimate po litical mentor, told me back in the 1930s that his strategy and Mr. Roosevelt’s was to assume the loyalty of Democrats who had voted for the party before 1932 and to aim at peo ple who had not been voting but who were radical in outlook. Flynn and Mr. Roosevelt scoffed at the idea of converting Republicans. They were people to attack, not flatter. Flynn scorned the idea of “independents.” I studied two British elections at firsthand, in 1950 and 1955, and talked with many professional workers in both parties in England, Scotland, Fraud a Office and Wales. The lasting lesson | learned was that those realists paid little attention to opposition voters, They used their resources to get out every sympathizer, and many needed plenty of prodding. The contest was a matter of efficiency, and since there were twice as many professional Con servative agents, the victory went to that party. It was left to the theorists in London and Oxford to believe that speeches were decisive. “Independ ents” over there are contemptuously known as “floaters.” So far as I know, Billy Graham is not trying to turn Catholics and Jews into Methodists and Baptists, but to get at the unaffiliated. He is much too wise to call the unwashed and un saved “independent.” MARKET FOR VOTES In 1952 Stevenson received about 27 million votes, which is roughly the sum of Truman’s (1948) 24 million, Wallace’s and Thurmond’s (1948) 1 million each, and a million more new voters in old Democratic families. Mr. Eisenhower received Dewey’s 22 mil lion plus some millions who had been conservatively inclined but in different in 1948, plus a number of new voters. Except in the South, there were few conversions. While the 1952 vote was large, there were and are somewhere around 40 million eligibles who failed to vote. That is the market for votes where either party may find a major ity. Those nonvoting eligibles are not “independent.” They are merely inac tive. Republicans may confidently assume that more that half of them are inclined to conservatism. The people who are talking about a static electorate also say that, since Democratic candidates for the House received in 1952 more votes than Re oublican candidates, the Republican Party is a permanent minority. They fail to add that there were 93 districts in which there were no contests and that 82 of them were Democratic. In all contested districts Republican can didates were 3,282,000 votes ahead. Except in describing a single elec tion, it is absurd to talk about minority or majority parties. The size of a party’s vote is whatever zeal and hard work can make it. —— Newsweek, August 13. 1956",1956,"sim_newsweek-us_1956-08-13_48_7.txt"
"2919","Perspective Registered U.S. Patent A Matter of Loyalty by Raymond os ANGELES—In his Chicago accept LE ance speech Adlai Stevenson said: “The truth is that President Eisenhower, cynically coveted as a candidate but ignored as a leader, is largely indebted to Democrats in Congress for what accomplishments he can claim.” The truth is in direct contradiction to this grave charge of disloyalty to the President against the Republican Party in Congress. Indeed, the candidate own charge by asserting, in the loose, fancyfree rhetoric which belies his in sixteen repetitions of the word “leadership,” that the President is no leader. We are therefore invited to believe that the Democrats in Congress have been following a ghostly nimbus. Also, Stevenson implies that he approves of the President's program. But selfcontradictions are common is the pleasant adornment of capri cious, disorderly. thinking. Let us ap peal to the facts. The candidate made this charge of disloyalty on July 14, citing as au thority the Congressional Quarterly. I challenged that private information service in this space under date of July 16, and my piece has been in serted in the Congressional Record with corroborative materials from Sen ators Schoeppel, Margaret Chase Smith, and others. Moley ROLLCALL ANALYSIS The respective chairmen of the Re publican Senate and Congressional Campaign Committees have inserted in the Congressional Record of Aug. 17 and Aug. 20 a complete analysis of all roll calls in both the 83rd and 84th Congresses. This represents a monumental job of research which can be checked and audited for accuracy. This analysis shows that after elim inating from the total roll calls in the two Congresses items which were merely procedural and organizational and also others which were not in the President’s program, there were 675 with which we are evaluating Republican concerned in loyalty to the President. a On these, majority of Republicans in both houses in both Congresses opposed the President in 10 per cent of the cases. A majority of Democrats opposed the President in 47 per cent of those cases. Office The analysis also shows that in all Eisenhower issues in both houses, the Republicans supplied 59 per cent of all votes cast for the program, and the Democrats 41 per cent of those votes. — Putting it another way, the record shows that the Democrats supplied 71 per cent of all opposition votes and the Republicans only 29 per cent. There were 345 House and Senate roll calls—or 51 per cent of the 675 Eisenhower roll calls—on which a ma jority of both parties were not united behind President Eisenhower's pro gram. These include the 10 per cent of the roll calls in which a majority of Republicans were opposed to the President’s program. Yet even after in cluding those, the Republicans sup plied 75 per cent of all the favorable votes on those 345 roll calls, and the Democrats only 25 per cent. Of the opposition votes, the Democrats sup plied 75 per cent, and the Republi cans, 25 per cent. NATURE OF ISSUES Moreover, in the detailed informa tion offered in the study concerning the nature of the issues in which some Democratic votes were necessary to win for the President, a _ very considerable proportion involved the EisenhowerBenson agricultural poli cies and a conflicting farm program of the Democrats. Others had to do with spending items in which the President had the support of economyminded Democrats. It comes with poor grace for the candidate of a party dedi— cated to overturning the Eisenhower Benson farm program and to more spending to claim credit for these. An examination of those roll calls in which a majority of Republicans supported and a majority of Demo crats opposed the President shows that the President won in 75 per cent of the cases in the Republican 83rd Congress and in only 41 per cent of the cases in the Democratic 84th Con gress. That forcefully illustrates why the President is asking for a Republi can Congress. }/ aT This record of loyalty is certainly ° bright in contrast with the troubled relations between the President and his party in Congress in the second: Roosevelt term and in 81st and’ 82nd: Congresses in Truman’s years.

The negative role of attack rests with the StevensonKefauver team. The FinneganButler plan leaves the job of capturing a Democratic Congress to the AFLCIO Committee on Po No doubt, if COPE achieves that, the Democratic organ ization will permit the political arms of unions to propose the program. It is clear that after this campaign, in which “big business” has been the major issue, the proposals in Congress will be designed to punish and de stroy big business by measures mainly in the field of taxation. For the New Deal long ago established taxation as the chief means of achieving eco nomic and social reform. The socalled “liberals” in Congress, including that very large group which has been and will be elected by: the multitudinous ‘REFORM’ workers of COPE, will be determined to overhaul or repeal the Comprehensive Revenue Act of 1954. The AFLCIO Resolution on Economic Issues, adopted by the first constitutional convention of the merged federations in December 1955, specified the program for which COPE will drive. First priority in tax cuts, it states, shall be given to reduction of excise taxes, an increase ir the individual incometax exemp ticns from the present level of $600, and a reduction of the 20 per cent rate for at least part of the first $2,000_ of taxable income.

FALSE ANALOGY Congressman Patman has a bill all ready to accomplish the latter objec tive. It would raise the surtax exemption from its present $25,000 to $100,000, and after that graduate the rates up to 75 per cent. Patman sup ports his plan with a false analogy. He says that if there is to be a graduated tax on individual incomes there should be one on corporations. But our largest corporations are owned in consider able part by small stockholders, and some little companies are owned by very rich people. Our five largest cor porations have 3 million stockholders. Under such a graduated corpora tion tax there would be restriction of growth, higher prices for products, and the breakup of large companies. The time for business management to meet this sort of threat is here and now. a a Management must take a lesson from COPE and provide manpower in the precincts to help elect members of Congress who have been unwilling to bow their heads to a single interest such as COPE. Chief Justice Marshall, borrowing a sentence from Daniel Webster, said: “The power to tax involves the power to destroy.” If under the leadership of COPE, victorious in the coming elec tion, the Congress sets to work to make good on the reckless, irrespon sible, vindictive attacks of Stevenson Kefauver, the smalls as well as the bigs may well be destroyed. Higher costs, higher prices, paralysis of in vestment and technological progress, bankruptcy, more mergers, and fewer jobs may well be the harvest. — Newsweek, October 22, 1956/",1956,"sim_newsweek-us_1956-10-22_48_17.txt"

Among other things, there was this sentence: “It was probably destined, when nature wove together the strands that be came the personality of Adlai Stevenson, that ‘at some disputed bar ricade’ his rendezvous would be not with glory but with bitter frustration.” Perhaps that is where, on the eve of the election, we should leave the subject. My neglect of the Democratic can didate was not merely because of feeling that he lacked what it took, but also because there have been two parties of opposition in this cam paign—the StevensonKefauver front and the vastly more concentrated and portentous drive of an organized effort by the AFLCIO Committee on Po litical Education and its egghead shadow, the ADA, to elect members of Congress.

For Reuther and his associates have what none of them have—neither senators nor governors nor local statesmen importance: A powerful organization limited by no state lines, with ten tacles over the nation, and flush with money and captive workers. In eight articles in this space I have attempted to describe the potential of COPE, its methods and objectives, Office Remains Moley a a a be to ¥. and the extent to which it has in fused itself into the soft, pervious organism that is the Democratic Party in the states. I have shown how in the 37 states outside the South Demo cratic senators have toed the COPE line to the extent of 73 per cent, while members of the House have made an 80 per cent score. Even such allegedly independent figures as Kennedy of Massachusetts and Pastore of Rhode Island deviated only to vote against 90 per cent parity, a matter of no importance to their constituents. The circumstance that impends, who ever wins the Presidency, is the ultimate transformation of the Demo cratic Party into a Britishmodel So cialistlabor party. In short, what happened to the Liberal: Party in Britain 30 years ago is the fate that almost certainly lies in the future of the party of Jefferson and Wilson. DISFRANCHISED There will be plenty of time after the election to discuss the necessity of reconstructing the Republican Party to provide a genuine alterna tive to this new party. My concern here, with only a few days before election, is to underline the extreme importance, despite the deadly opiate of confidence, of getting out the vote for conservative candidates for the House and Senate and for the State Legislatures. For every vote cast for them is not only another vote for the national ticket but an assist for candi dates who are fighting an uneven contest with little organized support on their side. It is true that millions of potential voters are not registered and cannot vote at the election. But the figures for 1952 show that 14,680,000 regis of tered voters failed to cast a ballot on Election Day. In some states the ab senteeism was appalling.

Interior Secretary Seaton has since asserted that there is no reason “to inflict the whole burden of financ ing those projects on the Federal government whenever and wherever nonFederal interests are willing to assume a share.” This will be a major test for a Presi dent whose popular majority should provide an unparalleled opportunity to protect the Treasury and the tax payers of all states from minority pres sures.

Industry will be the lure of subsidized Federal power. Vast sums have already been spent by the Federal government in the Columbia Basin. Approximately 40 per cent of the money spent by Congress for hydroelectric projects in the past ten years has gone to the Northwest. It has averaged $150 million a year.

Then the surtaxes above that would be reduced yearly at rates which in five years would bring the total paid by any individual down to 42 per cent. Corporate taxes would come down from 52 to 42 per cent. The bulk of individual relief would be in the basic rate, which now provides 83 per cent of the $33 billion raised from individuals.

The reduction in corporate rates would, in fact, enable a price reduction, since in reality the corporate tax is an excise paid by the consumer. The bill has a builtin safeguard which would permit the President and Congress to postpone a scheduled reduction for six months or a year, whenever there is danger of a deficit. If all possible postponements were used, the full reduction would take place in nine rather than five years. Authority for these reductions, however, would put the burden of proof on the President and Congress. There will be other plans for tax relief. But Sadlak has drawn attention to the substance of the problem.",1957,"sim_newsweek-us_1957-05-06_49_18.txt"

"2950","LOS ANGELES—More perceptive Californians are deeply concerned with what they believe to be the most important lesson to be learned from the recent Senatorial election in Wisconsin. This is the fact, there demonstrated, that names, however splendiferous, and Presidential sponsorship, however fervent, cannot avail against the drive of an efficient organization dedicated to getting out the vote. That is the sort of thing that gained for a man named Proxmire, in a byelection, nearly the entire normal Democratic vote. It may well get a lot of victims out here. It is the united political machinery of the labor unions in their effort to make their own laws by making their own lawmakers.",1957,"sim_newsweek-us_1957-09-16_50_12.txt"

"2956","Here are ominous figures. In 1948, when Mr. Truman carried California, Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives received 59 per cent of the vote. But in 1952, when the Presidential vote favored the Republican candidate, the Republican share of the House vote dropped to 54 per cent. In 1956, despite the big Eisenhower majority, it fell much more—to 46 per cent. As it fell, three districts switched from Republican to Democratic. In 1954 the CIO selected the Republican congressman in the Twelfth District (Fresno) for extermination, and succeeded. In 1956, the AFLCIO’s COPE (Committee on Political Education) moved into the Eleventh District and by a thoroughly professional job supplanted another Republican with a political newcomer. This invites a closer look at the trend. It shows that in the past four biennial elections hitherto solid Republican counties have become marginal, and marginal Republican counties have become marginal Democratic, and marginal Democratic counties have become solidly Democratic. This trend has been especially notable in the sparsely settled areas in the north, on the eastern border, and in the lush San Joaquin Valley. This is evidence of the recent AFLCIO strategy, no doubt created by Walter Reuther, of seeking Congressional seats where the attack is least expected and where the most seats can be gained with the least expenditure of money and manpower. Alliances in such areas are made with publicpower zealots, radical farmers, and other collectivist groups. Obvious examples are the Oregon sweep, and the capture of Senate seats in Idaho and Colorado. Note also the capture of the Twelfth California in 1954, and the Eleventh in 1956.",1957,"sim_newsweek-us_1957-09-16_50_12.txt"

Apparently the CQ revised its method of compiling records, but it has again been necessary for the Republican campaign chairmen in the Senate and House, Senator Schoeppel and Representative Simpson, to offer their own compilation of members' records. One of their compilations concerns Republican support of the President as compared with Democratic support. The other concerns the relative standing of the membership of the two parties on the vital issue of economy.

Our American war effort was utterly dependent upon the discoveries of these people, some of them dating back nearly 60 years. I note in the history of nuclear physics the names of Becquerel in 1896, followed by the Curies, Joliot, Becker, Chadwick, Urey, Brickwedde, Murphy, Hahn, Strassman, Rutherford, Mendeleev, Fermi, and Einstein. Most of these were not American born and some were driven from home by dictatorships.

"3768","Church membership in the United States is a matter of individual choice. Therein lies its essential strength and vitality. It may be argued that what is tonic for the churches is not tonic for labor unions. But human nature is involved in both. In the past, when an established church was disestablished, that church did not die. It usually remained active and vital. Widespread participation by the clergy of any church in a political debate invites the frightful peril of igniting the old issue of the separation of church and state. That issue flared momentarily when Alfred E. Smith aspired to the Presidency in 1928. But the magnificent restraint of the Catholic clergy in the campaign that year, in the face of bitter provocation by the opposition, left an aftermath of respect and admiration by people of all faiths, quieting the doubts about Catholics in high office.",1958,"sim_newsweek-us_1958-09-22_52_12.txt"

They should also realize that they are inviting the attack that plagued Governor Smith, that the Pope would interfere in American secular affairs.

There is on one side the right of an employer to make a contract for a union shop. But on the other is the right of a worker to join or not to join a union. But the resolving of such conflicting rights is the eternal task of statecraft. For example, there is the decision involved in weighing the responsibility of all taxpayers when a specific industry or locality is subsidized. In making such decisions, a political agency (using the word ""political"" in the sense of governmental) must consider the values involved, such as the preservation of an industry vital to the general welfare or national security, and whether the denial of a right can be sustained by those who lose it.",1958,"sim_newsweek-us_1958-09-22_52_12.txt"

"3780","Such decisions present political options in which empirical and historical evidence must predominate. The righttowork decision must consider whether, in fact, such laws do injure unionism. Experience in states where such laws are in effect is pertinent evidence. Also, whether compulsory unionism vests monopolistic power in the unions and corporations which make union shop contracts. Also, whether the dues will be used for the economic benefit of all workers or whether a part will go to the support of political candidates or principles that some members oppose, or for the personal power or perquisites of union leaders. There must also be considered whether the proper role of government is to protect the individual worker and consumer, or the groups of which some individuals are parts. These are examples of matters which are suitable to debate by people equipped and trained in the relevant facts and experience. The professional training of the clergy has involved spiritual and psychological values of much greater importance than those mundane affairs with which statesmen must deal. The guidance of the clergy in matters of individual conduct was never more needed than in these sinful times. Their vocation lies in that area.

"3819","REPUBLICANS who are applying the salivary emollient through the most primitive method known to the animal kingdom will, no doubt, after the sharpness of the pain has passed, conclude that what happened in the 1958 election may perhaps have a beneficial effect. Such a catastrophe has happened before, to both parties. The experience of wise people in those instances was that after the shock comes pain; after pain, depression; out of depression, reflection; and after reflection, action. But there must be reflection—plenty of it, in this case. The British Conservatives, after the votes were all counted in midsummer 1945, found themselves not just routed: They were slaughtered, scattered, numb. Only in 1832 and in 1906 had anything so terrible happened in British politics. The House of Commons count was Labor and allies, 399; Conservatives and allies, 213. In between were 28 Liberals, independents, and Irish Nationalists. The indomitable Churchill rallied the fragments, created a plan for thorough party reorganization, and then put at the head of the party organization no political routineer but a supersalesman, Lord Woolton. Woolton was no mere huckster, no fabricator of callow phrases. He was trained in the management of large affairs—as it happened, merchandising.",1958,"sim_newsweek-us_1958-11-17_52_20.txt"

"3823","Meanwhile, there ensued nearly five years of Labor government, during which no pie appeared in the sky. The trouble with a political party after a smashing victory is that it may be expected to fulfill its promises. The promises of defeated Republicans will be forgotten. That is the first lick on the wound. By 1950 the newly organized Conservative machine was able to get an almost even break in the House of Commons, and in 1951 that party took over once more. The failures of the Socialists helped, but it was organization that did the real job. I am not suggesting that an American party emulate the British political pattern in detail. But there are a number of principles inherent in the British Conservative renaissance that should serve as a guide for a complete overhauling of the Republican Party. First, there should be introduced a much larger element of competent management at both the national and state level, for American parties spend more and produce less than any other element in our national life. In accomplishing this, the brains, time, and energy of businessmen must be used to a far greater extent than now. Hitherto, politicians have regarded businessmen as a bovine sort, suitable only for biennial milking. Of course, money is needed in politics, but not so much as organized, directed man and woman power. A most careful appraisal of the spending habits of organizations should be made. What results are gotten from television, radio, billboards, and socalled literature? It is the personal touch that wins, together with a sparing use of the other media I have named.",1958,"sim_newsweek-us_1958-11-17_52_20.txt"

"3827","Second, an element of professionalism must be more widely used. The British Conservatives saw to it that constituencies were equipped with trained, paid, allyear agents or managers. These are essential to the recruitment, training, and direction of countless volunteers necessary to the detailed work of a campaign. The spare time of many, many retired people can be used—former business executives, Army and Navy officers, and CivilService employees with rich experience. Here I am not drawing from the British example but from what I know. Much more use should be made of the time and energies and common sense of women. Finally, specific issues and philosophy are needed. The occasional preachments of the President and the platitudes of platforms are wholly without substance. Republicans of all sorts, ""modern"" and traditional alike, should by some form of representation be gotten together to agree on what the party stands for—a faith and a program opposed to the dominant Democratic liberalism. I shall, from time to time, comment at length on that subject, for there is no need for a party split if all will use a bit of sense and forbearance.",1958,"sim_newsweek-us_1958-11-17_52_20.txt"

"3968","The Republican Party, in pursuing its policy of ridding itself of the tag of ""the party of the rich and big business,"" might reveal the extent to which ""liberal"" legislation provides rich windfalls, in the name of ""the little fellow,"" for a new rich and big business class. Consider the unfolding picture of public housing, slum clearance, and urban renewal in which windfalls are created for promoters, political lawyers and bankers, investors, contractors, and others. Or note that the chief beneficiaries of the soil bank are large corporations whose major profit is not in selling the product of their thousands of acres, but in government benefits. Many other avenues to riches might be cited for a few individuals and organizations who certainly are not ""needy"" or ""little""—all in the name of general welfare.",1959,"sim_newsweek-us_1959-07-06_54_1.txt"

"3970","The HumphreyPrice bill, which failed to pass over the President's veto, would have taken the Rural Electrification Administration away from the watchful eye of a fine public servant, Secretary Benson. The Washington lobby for rural electrification, many members of Congress, and zealots for a government power monopoly want to push ""rural"" electrification beyond the remote farmers, who are now supplied, to the suburbs and the cities. This would be deadly competition with investorowned companies because the government is lending money to the rural electrical cooperatives at 2 per cent—half or less what the government must pay for it.",1959,"sim_newsweek-us_1959-07-06_54_1.txt"

Most of them are content with sticking to their field with modest returns. But since they are associated in a sort of trade associationpressure lobby called the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, they are being led collectively into a vast scheme which promises illimitable profits not in the production and sale of electricity but in banking and investment. That is, so long as the present 2 per cent rate of borrowing from the government and taxfree status can be retained.",1959,"sim_newsweek-us_1959-07-06_54_1.txt"

It involves the brimming financial position of the cooperatives. The latest reports show a spectacular growth in their ""investments and savings"" account. In 1953 this was $43.7 million, in 1957 it was $192 million. The total earned surplus rose from $153 million in 1953 to $382 million in 1957.",1959,"sim_newsweek-us_1959-07-06_54_1.txt"

Twenty years ago, these union leaders realized that behind the facade of a very popular President the party units were hollow shells. Hence, those leaders moved in with money, manpower, and highly skilled political methods of getting out the vote and took over in many districts and states. They began at the level of the precinct—the city block, the apartment house, and the shop. Their agents were professional in two senses. They were paid, yearround employees of the unions themselves or, in the case of shop stewards, of management. They were also expertly trained in the downtoearth practice of union politics. While there should be more enforcement of the laws regarding the use of union funds, their power has amply been demonstrated by the number of political unknowns and greenhorns whom they elected to the 86th Congress.

There are the National Committee and the two campaign committees in the houses of Congress at the top. These have no direct authority over the countless local and state Republican organizations. Hence, there must be a clear distinction as to the functions of the local and state parties and the national organizations. The Alcorn program fails, it seems to me, to emphasize this distinction. The Republican Party can never regain its strength except as it is built from the bottom. The National Committee may suggest and to a degree help. It cannot impose its will upon the states and localities. And Alcorn’s suggestion of a group of 40 roving experts to go into states and work is impracticable and dangerous.

"4250","TOKYO—The most frequent question I have encountered in nearly three weeks in Japan is whether the United States is contemplating the recognition of Red China. This lies heavily on the minds of political and business leaders. Radical elements devoutly hope for it. Responsible people who see the perils involved fear it. If the United States should recognize Red China, Japan would of necessity follow suit. The consequence would be the loss of vast Southeastern Asia to the free world. Before long, the Communist frontier would reach to Australia, Hawaii, and our Pacific Coast. A friendly Japan would be exposed or absorbed.",1959,"sim_newsweek-us_1959-04-20_53_16.txt"

"4490","Perspective Registered Determinism’s by N AN interview on our activity in | space, an executive of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was asked why it should be necessary to send a man out there when we have such wonderful instruments. He answered: “Only a man can find what we are not looking for; an instrument can find only what we think is there.” This sentence of his throws a great light on a conflict in ideas that has been raging for the century since Marx and Darwin. There were those who believed that the seminal writings of these men unlocked an entirely new door to an interpretation of man and his place in the world. Their interpretation of science REFORMERS’ in history, politics, and nature was that man is a mere item in the mass of natural forces in the material world and uni verse. His personality, they held, was a composite of inherited instincts and of environmental influences. He had no free will and was without per sonal responsibility. In history, the application of this determinism was socalled economic interpretation. The American Revo lution thus became a squabble over taxes. The Constitution was made by men who sought protection for their securities and land. The two parties were mere congregations of debtors on one side and creditors on the other. In jurisprudence, the ancient con cept of the “Reign of Law” was re jected. Justice should be applied in accordance with what the judge be lieved to be justified by sociology and psychology. In court, the man’s en vironment was judged, not the culprit. DESTINY In politics, where determinism did its crowning mischief, a candidate or party merely added up the specific material yearnings of each of a group of minorities and made a total ma jority miscalled the general welfare. Elections thus became auctions of items of interest only to men’s stom achs and purses. Notable, even great men taught determinism as a tool to move human behavior. But what they properly con ceived to be a hint concerning human behavior, their lesser followers seized upon as a complete answer. A tool became a key. The sorcerer’s appren U.S. Patent Raymond Office Evil End Moley tices knew how to turn on the water, but not how to control it. Thus the melancholy destiny of reformers. Keynes said: Turn on more govern ment spending in depression; turn it off in recovery. But politics thought differently. The stimulant became food. Spending became a means to eternally accelerated growth. Even Marx is distorted by Com munism. Politicians cannot natural determinism. wait for They must use chicane, force, and brutality to hurry along the end of capitalism. The plans of the masters call for moves forward, backward, and sideways on the chess board of life, with men’s lives and liberty as pawns in the operation. Who is Mr. K to talk about the Presi dent’s responsibility? Personal respon sibility has no place in the doctrine K practices. For individual responsibility requires liberty to act and choose. And even K is responsible to the mas ter plan—impersonal, ruthless, inexo rable—in which he, too, is a pawn. ‘RESPONSIBLE FREEDOM’ The world is menaced by the con sequences of an acceptance of deter minism, by a blind acceptance of the implications of science as a weapon to destroy liberty everywhere. It is the scientists here whe have uttered the most eloquent warnings against the acceptance of scientific determinism. For they know the limits of their quest and the need for free dom in the welding of the tools for a better civilization. Witness Vannevar Bush’s warning to “preserve the re sourcefulness and initiative of free dom, and further the urge to create, with no stifling regimentation or deadening mediocrity.” Or Arthur H. Compton, who says this of what he calls “responsible freedom”: “I have learned from this experience [the atomic quest] the effectiveness of free men who are agreed upon one com mon purpose. The harmony comes as each sees and chooses the part he can do best toward the attainment of the desired end.” That end, as I understand him, is the use of science not as an end in itself, but as a means to the mainte nance of the individual’s freedom of choice in a world in which all liberty is living under a mortal threat.

It recognizes that . give to all without regard to need would be financial insanity. For no one knows how many would participate a free scheme for all. We do know, however, who that to limit assistance recipients of socialsecurity benefits would give to many who do not need help and omit many who do. For the Democratic platform to call social security (OASI) “insurance” wrong. “Insurance” was never used in the original Social Security Act. It has been judged by the Supreme Court to be a gratuity, not the pay ment of an equity in insurance. Those getting benefits paid out of the earnings those below retirement age and their employers.

To enact the Forand bill in any modified form would be legislating in the dark. I have read laboriously hun dreds of pages of hearings and other literature on the subject and I cannot find that anyone, in either Congress or the Administration, knows how many people would need such help or has any idea of what it would cost. It is further evident that no one in the government has fully explored how much of the problem could be solved by practical application of tax deductions. For example, a deduction for children or other relatives of aged persons so that private insurance could be bought. There is a moral issue here. Would or would not John F. Kennedy help Father Joe if he went broke and got sick? Or would he dis regard the moral strictures of religion and pass old, sick Joe over to a vague thing called society?

"4492","erspective Registered , U.S. Patent Office A New Kind of Campaign by Raymond Moley AMPAIGN orators are already filling the air with platitudes about the “new frontier” and the “challenge of the future” and all that sort of thing. But they must realize, especially those who are campaigning for the national tickets, that so far as campaigning goes, the future is already here. The maelstrom of world events in which we find ourselves and the actual phys ical business of campaigning distin guish this toplevel debate from all others in the past. After visiting a considerable num ber of states from coast to coast, and changes the air train, rest, Reasonable that ever was days. collect timate bruised mon after examining the communications I have received from those reporters who have visited other states, it is my conclusion that upheavals and flaring conflicts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are haunting American minds far more than the fate of the farmer, the family budget of the worker, con cern about possible catastrophic ill ness, or housing or school classrooms. These latter are important matters, but when there is the possible col lapse of the U.N. and maybe a spread of war which would engulf millions and cast death over the land for ci vilians as well as the military, there is priority among apprehensions. PARTY LINES IGNORED: More Americans than some of us realize would phrase their feelings like this: “Let’s let the home affairs be cared for by congressmen and sen ators and governors. The President is the one in whose judgment will rest the awful decisions which may mean peace or war, annihilation or secu raincoat. and port to lem speeches, shakes. of mental ical human may words deep rity.” Thus there is developing a dif ferentiation in the estimates of voters between district and state candidates and the two individuals who are run ning for President. I could name spe cifically half a dozen states in which it is more than likely that the majority will go to one party in the state elec tion and to the national candidates of the other party. Voters are likely to ignore party lines in evaluating the names on the national tickets. Moreover, the sheer physical de mands upon national candidates this year transcend anything candidates have known and felt in the past.

"4493","Perspective Labor and HE following is an account of : meeting between candidates Kennedy and Johnson and Sen. Harry Byrd in August. In the main, it based upon an article by a responsi ble reporter, der Linden, 1955 by Senators Kennedy, Clements, Douglas, Lehman, Pastore, Murray, and McNamara which proposed ex actly what the 1960 platform promises about “righttowork” laws. Kennedy answered that he “did not press its passage.” Kennedy could have done so because he was a member of the Labor Committee and could have in sisted upon hearings. There were no such hearings, and the bill died. KENNEDY S. Frank van published in Southern newspapers, in cluding. The Nashville Banner and The Greenville (S.C.) News. The ac count did not come from Byrd, but _ apparently from the Johnson people. In late August, Kennedy and Johnson had a meeting of Southern senators to win their support for the national ticket. Byrd was a conspicu ous absentee. Thereupon, Kennedy and Johnson asked to come to Byrd’s office to explain things. Byrd told the two candidates that he disagreed with most of the Los Angeles plat form, especially the pledge to repeal that section of the TaftHartley Act which permitted states to enact “righttowork” laws. Byrd was as sured by Kennedy and Johnson that such a repeal “won't necessarily be enacted if they are elected.” Byrd then confronted Kennedy with a bill (S. 1269) introduced TO MEANY Byrd made it clear then, as he did in the Senate in a speech, that he considered such a repeal an unwar ranted invasion of the right of a state to enact such a law. Twenty states have it, and in nine, “righttowork” is in the state constitution because a vote of the people. In the AFLCIO News for Oct. 1960, there appears a lengthy in terview of Kennedy by president George Meany: “Mr. Meany: Senator, I believe that kind of strong labor movement is made impossible by measures such as ‘righttowork’ laws. you think?” “Senator Kennedy: What Let me do make U.S. Patent Office Registered the Candidates by Raymond is in of 1, Moley it clear once again, as I have in the past, that—whatever office I shall hold —I shall always be unalterably op posed to socalled ‘righttowork’ laws at any level, Federal or state ... To achieve that goal [preserve and pro tect the legitimate rights of legitimate unions] now means the elimination of some antilabor sections of the present labor laws. To that end, I am _ un equivocally committed.” Nixon opposes the repeal of that section of TaftHartley. FACING BOTH WAYS While the great majority of the leaders of the big unions are com mitted to the KennedyJohnson ticket, the millions of members who have elected them and supported them with their dues should consider se riously the foregoing accounts of what Kennedy and Johnson have said—in one case to the South, and in the other to the unions through their offi cial publication. The wisdom and effectiveness of “righttowork” laws is not the issue here. The issue goes to the validity of a party platform and the pledges of party candidates. That is a matter for union members to consider. It also goes to the constitutional right of a state to legislate on a sub ject which concerns its internal af fairs. If the Federal government can invade a right of a state, validated by the courts, to pass these laws— and twenty states have exercised that right—there will remain little in a state’s province that cannot be taken away by a triumphant, powerful ma jority in Congress backed by a Presi dent who believes in such invasions. That is a matter for citizens of the South, indeed for all Americans, to consider. This goes to the essence of the kind of government we shall have in the United States. It is well known that the Southern States are bitterly opposed to most of the provisions of the Los Angeles platform. Texas Democrats made that position official in their state platform. Johnson said recently on “Meet the Press” that he had not calculated what either platform would cost. Thus, he has endorsed a_ platform which to him has no meaning in terms of money or taxes.

"4494","Perspective The a a to a N THE midst of all the handon heart declarations of politicians concerning the Negroes who are pre vented from voting and the boasts that the right to vote has been ex tended by Federal law to enfranchise those people, to my knowledge noth ing has been said or done by either party for 8 million voters who were unable to vote on Nov. 8. These are American citizens who have moved from state to state. This number would be enough to swing the Presi dential balance in a number of states in a close election. In NEWSWEEK’s own organization I know a consider able number of executive, sales, and editorial personnel who lost their 1960 votes because of being shifted from state to state. As we turn to much larger business enterprises, the numbers run very high. Great corporations engaged in man ufacturing or oil production and dis tribution or chain stores must of necessity shift managers, salesmen, and other executives constantly. Each such shift made within a year dis franchises in must cases at least two votes and in some cases more. There is no rational reason why these people should not be permitted to vote for President and Vice President. The bar to voting in 35 of the states is the requirement of one year’s resi dence for eligibility. Three states re quire two years. Others require six months. Perhaps reasons may be of fered why relative strangers in a com munity or state should not participate in electing state and local officials, since their familiarity with local con ditions may be inadequate to justify a voice in such choices. But that does not apply to the election of the Presi dent and Vice President, who are na tionally known and who must serve all the people in all the 50 states. CORRECTION BY LAW This injustice could, of course, be corrected by legislation in the states. According to the American Heritage it! Foundation, a nonpartisan organiza tion which has done a splendid job in getting out the vote for several years, three states have made such changes in their voting requirements. Cali fornia has fixed the residence re quirement at 54 days; Missouri at Disfranchised by Raymond 60 should not apply to voting for mem bers of the Senate and House of Rep resentatives, because under our system these are selected not only to make laws to apply to all, but to rep resent in Congress the interests of their states. Moley days, and Ohio at 40 days But such changes in state laws take a long time. Voting qualifications are embedded in many state constitutions, It seems to me that Federal legisla. tion might be held constitutional which would permit every qualified American citizen to cast a vote fo President and Vice President where he has lived for 30 days. I have not studied the cases on this, but I invite lawyers and election officials who may read this to write and give me their opinions. Perhaps such liberalization TWODAY ELECTIONS According to the American Herit age Foundation’s statement, three other groups were disfranchised for no substantial reason. There were 7.6 million who were business travelers or sick and hospitalized who lost their votes because of the variations of re quirements among the states for =) sentee ballots. There are also the 600,000 disfranchised in the District of Columbia. Barring the latter rests upon reasons which have long since lost any rational meaning. Eight hundred thousand illiterates are barred, which is proper despite the radical proposal of the Demoesatil platform to abolish all literacy tests. | There are millions more who areh barred because of moving about within states and who do not under stand the complicated process of new registration. Changes of registration take time and knowledge. Another suggestion would be to provide two days for elections. This is allowed in some European countries. When we are selecting people to serve us for two or four years, two days for voting would not be too long for making the momentous choices. The low percentage of voting among those who are eligible has been and remains a blot on our national con: science, but that low percentage could be raised by a_reconsidera tion and simplification of our absur and obsolete electoral system.

I then received a great many letters dis agreeing with me. Most were from Protestant ministers. This left me with only the sad satisfaction that at any rate my small effort had helped to unite the Christian churches on least this one subject. Never have so many letters come in about an article until now. This time they are all in response to what I wrote in this space three weeks ago about the millions who were pre vented from voting because of resi dence requirements. In this instance all the letters were in accord. Some letters were from people who were themselves the victims of absurd and outworn residence requirements.

NOBLY CONCEIVED red or MESS The denial of the right to vote is subject which governors should deal with in their annual messages and which legislators should consider the new year. There can be only one conclusion from the abundant evi dence on hand. Democracy is a nobly conceived experiment. But in its op eration in the United States it is mess. While there are millions of peo ple who are too careless and apathetic and selfish to care about voting, there are millions of others who want vote and cannot. It now appears not only that many have been disfranchised because clumsy laws and customs, but that indeterminate number who legiti mately voted were not counted the final returns—enough, perhaps, have reversed the final choice of President.
