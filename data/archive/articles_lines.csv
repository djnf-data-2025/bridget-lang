"1062","The Republican Party, in pursuing its policy of ridding itself of the tag of ""the party of the rich and big business,"" might reveal the extent to which ""liberal"" legislation provides rich windfalls, in the name of ""the little fellow,"" for a new rich and big business class. Consider the unfolding picture of public housing, slum clearance, and urban renewal in which windfalls are created for promoters, political lawyers and bankers, investors, contractors, and others. Or note that the chief beneficiaries of the soil bank are large corporations whose major profit is not in selling the product of their thousands of acres, but in government benefits. Many other avenues to riches might be cited for a few individuals and organizations who certainly are not ""needy"" or ""little""—all in the name of general welfare.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_1.txt"
"1063","The Humphrey-Price bill, which failed to pass over the President's veto, would have taken the Rural Electrification Administration away from the watchful eye of a fine public servant, Secretary Benson. The Washington lobby for rural electrification, many members of Congress, and zealots for a government power monopoly want to push ""rural"" electrification beyond the remote farmers, who are now supplied, to the suburbs and the cities. This would be deadly competition with investor-owned companies because the government is lending money to the rural electrical cooperatives at 2 per cent—half or less what the government must pay for it.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_1.txt"
"1064","**SPECTACULAR GROWTH**","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_1.txt"
"1065","No one questions the validity of the original purpose of the REA, nor the wholesome character of most of the 900 cooperatives. Most of them are content with sticking to their field with modest returns. But since they are associated in a sort of trade association-pressure lobby called the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, they are being led collectively into a vast scheme which promises illimitable profits not in the production and sale of electricity but in banking and investment. That is, so long as the present 2 per cent rate of borrowing from the government and tax-free status can be retained.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_1.txt"
"1066","The head of the NRECA, Clyde C. Ellis, is a man of vast imagination coupled with incredible political influence. At the last meeting of his organization he unfolded the plan. It involves the brimming financial position of the cooperatives. The latest reports show a spectacular growth in their ""investments and savings"" account. In 1953 this was $43.7 million, in 1957 it was $192 million. The total earned surplus rose from $153 million in 1953 to $382 million in 1957.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_1.txt"
"1067","Ellis proposed that the investment account be put into his NRECA in trusteeship—an unusual function for a trade association-pressure organization. Then he proposed that this pool be placed with a New York bank for investment opportunities.

"1077","It must not be forgotten that Khrushchev rose to power as a sort of agricultural genius. Not even the mystical Henry Wallace has had such wonderful farm plans as the Jolly Slav. But unlike our Henry, Mr. K had direct methods of demonstrating his talents. Henry had statistics at his command and some authority. But he was always hampered by his naïve ideas, which he designated as ""democratic."" Mr. K permitted no such impediments. Furthermore, he created his own statistical successes.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"
"1078","He originated in a Ukrainian village and has posed as an agrarian expert, a man close to the people who toil on collective farms.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"
"1079","It was Mr. K who, a few years ago, opened vast tracts east of the Urals for ""progressive agriculture."" It was a foolhardy venture and there was plenty of headshaking among the hardhanded, practical people who knew well the hostile, arid wastes of Kazakhstan. But a plan's a plan in the Soviet, regardless of the Lord, nature, and experience. And so men, tractors, and then women were shipped into the semi-desert.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"
"1080","While Henry Wallace was a deeply religious man with mystical overtones and Mr. K certainly is not, apparently the rain falls upon the just and unjust alike, this time heavily in favor of the latter. The rain came, a mild temperature prevailed, and the stuff grew. Mr. K was photographed smiling over a large potato.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"

"1082","Statistics don't lie, they say, but it depends upon what you are counting and when. Facts can be manipulated to suit a purpose. In Mr. K's rise after Stalin's death, he made a sensational announcement: ""Soviet Russia has fewer cattle than there were in czarist Russia."" Specialists pondered this astonishing assertion. They found that Mr. K had classified cows as pigs and, statistically, transformed horned cattle into mares. Thus at the beginning of his enterprise he could point with alarm. After three years, statistical pigs were reincarnated as cows and the ""mares"" resumed their bovine classification. The Khrushchev propaganda duly capitalized upon this miracle. Wallace had a host of statisticians and knew in his off hours various haruspices. If he had succeeded, as he is doing now with chickens, in cross breeding the two species, his farm plans might have been the wonder of the ages. That miracle belongs to the atheist, Mr. K.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"
"1083","Americans are familiar with the Soviet boast, ""Whatever you do we can do better."" An American Army officer in Tokyo whose thumb was double jointed illustrated to a Russian officer how he could bend his thumb back to his forearm. The Russian did it and was immediately consigned to the Tokyo hospital. Readers of ""War and Peace"" will remember the officer who consumed a bottle of vodka while standing on a window ledge.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"

"1085","This Russian trait will be apparent in Mr. K's travels here. When Frol Kozlov, First Deputy Premier, visited the Middle West, NEWSWEEK'S Harry Homewood was present and relates the indifference of Kozlov and his retinue of Soviet photographers and newsmen. There was no evidence of surprise or admiration until they reached a dairy farm in Grundy County, Illinois. Up to then the standard comment was that ""we have it too"" and ""more and bigger."" But when they entered the farmer's milkhouse their interest rose to fever heat. The arrangement was normal for such an establishment—a three-stand automatic milker which transported the milk from cows to a stainless-steel collecting tank and thence to a truck. All was housed quite antiseptically. Every pipe and joint in the contraption was photographed amid great jostling and talking.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"
"1086","After collecting this evidence of an American achievement, they resumed their ""We-can-do-it-better."" One of them asked the meaning of ""co-or"" on the truck. A representative of the State Department explained. One of the Soviet reporters threw up his hands in a gesture of self-confidence, ""Ah, Communism!"" he exclaimed. Whatever Mr. K says ad lib is not the important matter for observation. But what he and his group instinctively reveal in wonder and admiration certainly is. That is what they will carry away for future reflection.","1959-09-28",1959,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_3.txt"

"1216","Now, seven weeks after witnessing the rout of the Labor Party in Britain and after visiting three other countries in Europe, it is time to appraise the political revolution which seems to be quietly moving over our Western allies. It is the ascendency of experience over experimentation, the realization of the possible over prophecy, things over ideology, and fact over fancy. We might consider this in our calculations for 1960.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1217","Ireland, in turmoil since Cromwell, is quiet, reasonably well to do, a bidder for the tourist trade. West Germany, as I noted in an earlier article, has its ""Wirtschaftswunder."" This expression, the title of a book on America in 1920 by Julius Hirsch, is their word for ""economic miracle."" The old Socialist party, the Social Democrats, has this month renounced Marxism as an anachronism. Italy, with considerable poverty still in the south, is mostly prosperous and safely governed by the Christian Democrats.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1218","Most important to us as we approach another election is the plight of the British Labor Party. As Lord Woolton says in his recently published memoirs, the adoption of the name ""Labor Party"" by the Socialists was an inspiration. But now the name is a millstone because it suggests the idea of a class party. And class distinctions are becoming less important over there by the day. There are the poor and needy, but they are no longer identical with the workers. Nationalization has no appeal. Thus, the two tenets of Socialism, the class struggle and government ownership, fade into the past, leaving Hugh Gaitskell and his more practical colleagues with a party without an issue.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1219","**AN ILL-ASSORTED LOT**","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1220","What was significant in the British election was not the third victory of the Conservatives, but the actual fourth rejection of Labor. For in the election of 1950 a fat majority of 186 in the House of Commons was reduced to a little more than a dozen. Labor's great sweep in 1945 was a wholly abnormal manifestation of weariness, impatience, and near-despair by a nation eviscerated by a long war.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1221","At the forthcoming conference of the Labor Party there will be underlined the internal malaise with which it is afflicted. The creators of the party and its component elements have always been an ill-assorted lot. There were the armchair, doctrinaire Fabians like Shaw, economists like the Webbs, bitter haters of everything traditional like Aneurin Bevan, trade unionists, welfare workers, amateur university intellectuals, and politicians who were refugees from the prostrate Liberal Party.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1222","This aggregation was ill-fitted to provide a major alternative for the business of government. In the past, the alternative to the Tories had been the Liberals led by such great parliamentarians as Gladstone and Asquith. These offered differences in emphasis and in direction. But a wide similarity of purpose permitted the two parties to alternate in governing Britain with no revolutionary changes.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1223","**PARTY OR MOVEMENT**","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1224","Within the present parliamentary minority there are men, like Gaitskell, who would like to fulfill a function similar to that of the Liberals of the past. But the composition and support of the party frustrates this ideal. For the party has its share of zealots still intent upon Marxist goals. Moreover, it must depend for finances upon the trade unions, which are concerned with more immediate practical advantages. Compromise must be sought at every turn—impossible compromises considering the composition of the party following. As someone wrote during the campaign, Gaitskell is at a loss as to whether he is the head of a responsible party suited to govern, or the high priest of a reform movement. This is his dilemma. Unless it can be resolved, his party may die. Surely it can never regain power in its present state.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"
"1225","During the campaign Gaitskell followed a line known to Americans through Democrats like the Humphreys and Republicans like the Rockefellers and Javitses. It promises lower taxes and high spending, to be paid for out of a hypothetical increase in the rate of production. The British refused the gamble. Americans, if they are wise, should also reject such economic illusions.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_5.txt"

"1348","by Raymond Moley","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1349","THERE are still old-fashioned folks among us who believe that high taxes discourage hard work, extra effort, more production, and hence more income and more taxes to pay. They agree with the tramp in the cartoon who said: ""I finally found a way to beat the income tax and I haven't worked since.""","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1350","But there is a school of modern economists, well represented in the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration, who are undermining this last remaining tenet of more primitive times. These economists hold that the exact opposite is true.","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1351","Prof. Sumner H. Slichter, who has his moments of empyrean flight, puts forth the New Thought this way: ""High taxes on profits may even be stimulating rather than discouraging [to business].""","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1352","No one objects to people speculating on such things in Harvard—as long as they stay in Harvard. When they become policymakers in the government of the United States, however, their ideas become a matter of public concern, in this case of great concern. Slichter's generality seems to have been based upon a curious book, ""The Effects of Taxation on Executives,"" by Thomas H. Sanders, also a Harvard Business School professor. It was edited by Dan Throop Smith, a professor on leave, who, when appointed to serve with Under Secretary Marion B. Folsom, was announced as ""responsible for analysis and building of tax policy.""","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1353","Can it be that the Administration's insistence upon a continuation of the iniquitous excess-profits levy was based at least in part upon the theories of Smith who still believes the Sanders book to be sound?","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1354","Prof. David McCord Wright, in an address published by the National Industrial Conference Board, neatly dissects the book. He points out that the conclusions of the author are ""merely a write-up, heavily edited, of a somewhat haphazard collection of interviews."" Professor Wright also points out that even the interviews presented by Sanders contain a good deal of evidence that high taxes are a deterrent on business enterprise.","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1355","In a passage where Sanders discusses the comments made by self-made executives about their sons, he says that said sons ""are not occupied with work, progress in business... but with the good life, good living, and forms of social service."" Wright observes that he is ""surprised that a business school of all institutions should release a book in which the 'good life' is in some way opposed to work."" Of course, Harvard will claim that Sanders' opinions are in the realm of academic freedom. That might mean that people who do not believe in success should teach young men how to succeed.","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1356","I would add to Wright's criticism two further observations. The first is that this school of economists seem to have revived a myth which they, of all people, have always labored to dissipate—the ""economic man."" They have created a new economic man—this time, ""the businessman,"" and have tried to put an abstraction into material form. Who knows what predominates in the mass of impulses that drives him to scorn delights and live laborious days? And who can devise a generality that fits such a conglomerate of people?","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1357","My other observation is that once more we see an effort to use taxation to produce something other than revenue. New Deal economists used taxes for all sorts of things—for reforming people generally, for redistributing wealth, for abolishing poverty, for breaking up big business, and even for hunting down criminals. Now comes a new use. It is to make men work! Material profit may not be the sole motive that moves us. But the earned dollar is still a measure of the value that others put upon our efforts and as such it is a measure of personal achievement and personal satisfaction.","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"
"1358","**P**ROGRESSIVE taxation, notably in taxes on business, is designed to put the heaviest penalty on that last extra effort that marks the difference between mediocrity and excellence. Surely, that is not the way to promote national progress and high endeavor. Government was not designed to determine what makes men work.","1953-09-28",1953,9,28,"moley_perspective_AI_21.txt"

"1363","by Raymond Moley","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1364","ADDRESSING himself to the disgraceful exhibition of bias and bad manners by some of the correspondents at the President’s Armistice Day press conference, Richard Wilson of the Cowles publications said: “There was an excessive abuse of the privilege of the press by newspapermen who ought to know better.” It took courage for Wilson to say this, but he has courage as well as an unusual sense of the responsibilities of his profession.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1365","But the Armistice Day exhibition and the outburst of criticism that it brought to the correspondents seem to have taught them nothing. For the reporting of the President’s press conference on Nov. 18 was in many papers a clear misstatement of what Mr. Eisenhower said. It was widely reported that the President indicated that he did not want the Communist issue to be a major factor in the 1954 campaign. This was easily interpreted to mean that he was opposed to an earlier statement of National Chairman Hall that the Communist issue would really be a major factor. This follows a line very clearly marked out by partisan Democrats and intended to drive a wedge between the President and the Republican National Committee. The President’s statements were also stretched by some correspondents and commentators to mean that he is inimical to Congressional probes of Communism in government.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1366","Let us see what the President said. This is the salient part of the report of the press conference in which the President is replying to a question which quoted Chairman Hall and went on to ask the President’s opinion concerning the Communist issue in 1954:","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1367","“Issues in political campaigns are not made by any individual, and that includes the President of the United States. Issues are made, as he sees it, by the needs of the country… We know that the cleaning out in government, of course, is important… He is proceeding with his associates, the President said, as strongly and as earnestly and as thoroughly as he can in that direction, and he is trying to do it without doing injustice to any individual… Now, he added, he hopes that this whole thing will be a matter of history by the time the next election comes around.”","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1368","That is a correct statement of the basic fact that issues are made by the interests and concerns of the public. It is also a clear statement of confidence in his Attorney General.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1369","Later, Chairman Hall said: “I am in complete agreement with the President, but I don’t think that the people will quickly forget that the Communists entered the government under the previous Administrations, and that they have been ousted and removed by the Eisenhower Administration.”","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1370","To paraphrase Hall, candidates are going to ask the voters to remember who it was who put the Communists in government and who drove them out. The latter will include not only the President and Attorney General but committees of Congress, which pursued subversion despite fierce criticism, and respective chairmen of those committees.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1371","One of the most blatant examples of bias in the Armistice Day conference was provided by Anthony Leviero of The New York Times, who said: “Mr. President, I think this case is at best a pretty squalid one.” The rest of his long speech-question was equally loaded with prejudice.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1372","But a week later, The Times permitted him to conduct a pell-mell poll of reporters on the question whether the Eisenhower Administration had embraced McCarthyism and to write a prejudiced story about it in a prominent place in the paper. The problem of press behavior therefore moves beyond the individual reporter to the paper itself.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"
"1373","CONSIDERING the way things are going, the President should adopt one of two courses. Either abolish the Presidential press conference or put it on television. The public is entitled to know exactly what the President says and the tones and emphasis with which he speaks. The proof is mounting that a considerable number of Washington correspondents are unwilling to provide a definitive interpretation of what the President says.","1953-11-30",1953,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_27.txt"

"1505","Despite the ballyhoo for Federal aid that will surround the forthcoming White House Conference on Education, two serious obstacles stand in its way. The first is the fear in the South that Federal money would be used to enforce desegregation. The other is the rational and factual argument against resorting to Federal aid to meet the needs of our schools.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1506","That rational and factual argument against any Federal plan has never been stated better than in a booklet just published by the American Enterprise Association in Washington, D.C. This study, invaluable to the citizen lost in the turbulent sea of statistics and semantics, is entitled ""Federal Aid to Education—Boon or Bane?"" Its author is Roger A. Freeman, assistant to Governor Langlie of the State of Washington. Freeman served as chief adviser to the Bennion committee of the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations which last spring presented very strong exceptions to plans for Federal aid which were before Congress at that time.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1507","Some of the pertinent questions on this subject with Freeman’s answers are these:","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1508","Is there a denial of schooling for American children and if so how severe is it? The National Education Association, a chief proponent of Federal aid, has claimed that 4,599,000 children were not attending school in 1954. Freeman answers that this figure includes 3 million 5-year-old kindergartners and 1.1 million who were beyond the compulsory attendance age in their states.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1509","Is there a teacher shortage? Not as great as in many other important professions and occupations.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1510","What about salaries? Between 1939 and 1953 the pay of educators rose 47 per cent. This was higher than the rise of managers, proprietors, professional and technical workers. It was lower than skilled and unskilled industrial workers.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1511","How big is the need for new school construction? The estimates have a bewildering variety running from 476,000 to 176,000 schoolrooms. It is an obvious fact that slavish adherence to tradition in the observance of hours of use and vacations means that school property is grossly underused.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1512","Can states and local governments afford to meet their own needs in school construction and teachers’ salaries? For the most part, yes. No state has exhausted its taxing powers and both states and local communities still have vast borrowing capacity.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1513","Could Federal aid be provided equitably and rationally? No! For politics would require some form of across-the-board aid in which both the rich and poor would participate. No one has yet devised a politically acceptable method of applying Federal aid only where there is a genuine need.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1514","Could we have Federal aid without Federal control? Dr. S.M. Brownell, now U.S. Commissioner of Education, said in 1939: “If Federal aid is to bring about better schools, it seems apparent that there must be some Federal control.” Control by a Federal bureau would be bad enough but there would, to a degree, be control of that bureau by national pressure groups such as the NEA.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1515","My own conclusion, after a careful perusal of this Freeman study, is that while there are spots where there is real need and where local districts and other units are short of resources, a clumsy, politically inspired system of Federal aid would not meet those real needs while it would waste money on places where no need exists. What is needed is a nonpolitical, independent, and scientific determination of needs and resources and the application of money accurately designed to meet only genuine necessities. This sort of aid is a job for private philanthropy, not the government.","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"
"1516","The Ford Foundation through its “Fund for the Advancement of Education” has made a very considerable study of the subject. Why shouldn’t the Ford Foundation with its resources in billions undertake to go beyond mere surveys and provide the help that is needed? The Ford money came from the Main Streets of America. Why shouldn’t a large part of that money be spent there?","1955-11-28",1955,11,28,"moley_perspective_AI_52.txt"

Quite properly, these promises are made with the qualification that drastic budget cuts should precede tax cuts. There is another qualification which may or may not be observed. When and if tax relief comes, it should be something more than a mere handout, such as a raising of exemptions. A tax plan should recognize a number of very important principles:","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"
"1523","It should provide relief all along the line. It should be a program of reduction extending over a period of years. It should recognize that the evil in present rates is their steep progression. It should provide the greatest relief for the middle-income groups—the real victims of present policies. It should recognize that more revenue may well be gained from lower, rather than higher, rates. It should discourage the growth of government, particularly Federal expenditures. It should moderate the tax on individuals and on small businesses, and also discourage the unproductive disposition of large incomes now made to escape taxes.","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"
"1524","THE “NEW BOUNTY”","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"
"1525","Finally, and I believe most important, it should give the benefit of the anticipated growth of our national production to taxpayers, not to specially selected beneficiaries of handouts. One of the most pernicious of economic theories which now prevail in Washington is that, since we may anticipate about $3 billion or $4 billion increases in our national product, this “new bounty,” as Candidate Stevenson called it in his campaign, should go for increases in Federal expenditures. This “new” economics is more dangerous than that promulgated by the late Lord Keynes. For Keynes favored cutting back spending in good times. The “new bounty” economics, popular not only among “liberal” Democrats but among economic wizards in the Eisenhower Administration, would continue spending increases in good times because there is more wealth to tax. Antoni N. Sadlak has been a hard-working and clear-thinking congressman from Connecticut for more than ten years. Out of his experience on the Ways and Means Committee and other sources, he has developed a tax-reduction plan embodied in H.R. 6452. This bill recognizes the principles listed above. It does not cover all inequities, but it strikes at the most pernicious, which are in the individual and corporate income taxes.","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"
"1526","GRADUAL REDUCTION","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"
"1527","His plan would contemplate a gradual reduction in rates over a period of five years beginning next January. The reductions specified would give to the taxpayers the benefit of the “new bounty” without reducing the actual revenues of the Federal government. If the President and Congress will keep expenditures down, it might be possible under such a plan to pay off a part of the debt. The Sadlak plan would start with a reduction of 1 per cent a year in the basic 20 per cent rate. Then the surtaxes above that would be reduced yearly at rates which in five years would bring the total paid by any individual down to 42 per cent. Corporate taxes would come down from 52 to 42 per cent. The bulk of individual relief would be in the basic rate, which now provides 83 per cent of the $33 billion raised from individuals. The extremely high rates yield relatively little revenue at present. People in the brackets above 26 per cent paid, in 1956, only seven per cent of the total individual income taxes. Those in the brackets above 80 per cent paid less than two per cent. The reduction in corporate rates would, in fact, enable a price reduction, since in reality the corporate tax is an excise paid by the consumer. The bill has a built-in safeguard which would permit the President and Congress to postpone a scheduled reduction for six months or a year, whenever there is danger of a deficit. If all possible postponements were used, the full reduction would take place in nine rather than five years. Authority for these reductions, however, would put the burden of proof on the President and Congress. There will be other plans for tax relief. But Sadlak has drawn attention to the substance of the problem.","1957-05-06",1957,5,6,"moley_perspective_AI_59.txt"

"1533","LOS ANGELES—More perceptive Californians are deeply concerned with what they believe to be the most important lesson to be learned from the recent Senatorial election in Wisconsin. This is the fact, there demonstrated, that names, however splendiferous, and Presidential sponsorship, however fervent, cannot avail against the drive of an efficient organization dedicated to getting out the vote. That is the sort of thing that gained for a man named Proxmire, in a by-election, nearly the entire normal Democratic vote. It may well get a lot of victims out here. It is the united political machinery of the labor unions in their effort to make their own laws by making their own lawmakers.","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1534","The headlines and political small talk here and in most of the country concern the shining sons of the Golden State—the Chief Justice, the Vice President, the Republican leader of the Senate, and the California governor. But while these eminent men have been sweeping this state over and over, a far, far more important operation has been in action—something to reckon with after Warren, Nixon, Knowland, Knight, even Mr. Eisenhower, have vanished from the front pages.","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1535","**REPUBLICAN LOSSES**","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1536","Here are ominous figures. In 1948, when Mr. Truman carried California, Republican candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives received 59 per cent of the vote. But in 1952, when the Presidential vote favored the Republican candidate, the Republican share of the House vote dropped to 54 per cent. In 1956, despite the big Eisenhower majority, it fell much more—to 46 per cent. As it fell, three districts switched from Republican to Democratic. In 1954 the CIO selected the Republican congressman in the Twelfth District (Fresno) for extermination, and succeeded. In 1956, the AFL-CIO’s COPE (Committee on Political Education) moved into the Eleventh District and by a thoroughly professional job supplanted another Republican with a political newcomer. This invites a closer look at the trend. It shows that in the past four biennial elections hitherto solid Republican counties have become marginal, and marginal Republican counties have become marginal Democratic, and marginal Democratic counties have become solidly Democratic. This trend has been especially notable in the sparsely settled areas in the north, on the eastern border, and in the lush San Joaquin Valley. This is evidence of the recent AFL-CIO strategy, no doubt created by Walter Reuther, of seeking Congressional seats where the attack is least expected and where the most seats can be gained with the least expenditure of money and manpower. Alliances in such areas are made with public-power zealots, radical farmers, and other collectivist groups. Obvious examples are the Oregon sweep, and the capture of Senate seats in Idaho and Colorado. Note also the capture of the Twelfth California in 1954, and the Eleventh in 1956.","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1537","**COPE’S HARVEST**","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1538","The trend is notable in the State Legislature. In 1953 there were in the Assembly 44 Republicans and 36 Democrats. In 1957 there were 42 Republicans and 38 Democrats. (There has been one Republican gain in a by-election recently.) In the Senate in 1953 there were 29 Republicans and 11 Democrats. In the recent 1957 session the Senate party count was 20-20, and Governor Knight told me recently that two of the Republicans were voting with the Democrats.","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"
"1539","This drive for the legislature is intended not only as a means of stopping any legislation opposed by the unions, but for the more important purpose of controlling the reapportionment of the state after the census of 1960, when it is expected that the present U.S. House representation of 30 will climb to 38 or 40. Gerrymandering will give AFL-CIO several additional easy districts.","1957-09-16",1957,9,16,"moley_perspective_AI_70.txt"

This is never difficult to do, for a member of Congress must register many votes and by a process of selection and omission he can be made to appear in a most unfavorable light. In 1956, so far as Republican members are concerned, this was made more annoying because a private publication, the Congressional Quarterly, in its reports had in its choice of roll calls permitted partisans to draw the inference that the President's support came largely from Democrats.","1957-10-21",1957,10,21,"moley_perspective_AI_72.txt"

Subsequently, Senator Schoeppel, chairman of the Republican campaign committee, spread on the record a full account of members' voting which substantiated my own. Apparently the CQ revised its method of compiling records, but it has again been necessary for the Republican campaign chairmen in the Senate and House, Senator Schoeppel and Representative Simpson, to offer their own compilation of members' records. One of their compilations concerns Republican support of the President as compared with Democratic support. The other concerns the relative standing of the membership of the two parties on the vital issue of economy.

Schoeppel points out that the CQ ""did not include many issues that were of great significance…"" One of these, he says, was the Hells Canyon bill, on which the Democrats voted favorably 40-5, and Republicans opposed 33-5. In the roll calls which Schoeppel cites, 63.7 per cent of the economy votes were by Republicans; only 36.3 were by Democrats.","1957-10-21",1957,10,21,"moley_perspective_AI_72.txt"

The Democrats cast 70.7 per cent of all spending votes."" The Schoeppel-Simpson researches indicate great care. It is a pity, however, that this vital matter is thus left to rival claims. Would it not be a wise thing for both parties in Congress to set up a bipartisan statistical agency which might make plain and easily understandable the votes of the parties as a whole and of individual members? Then let the voters decide.

"1683","The homely metaphor of the three-legged stool will serve to describe what the Republican Party needs to stabilize itself. For there are laws in politics as well as in physics which forbid defiance of gravity. Many people glibly assume that all the GOP needs is a new party philosophy and bright new faces on the tickets.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1684","It is true that the party needs a fighting faith, sharply distinguished from that of the so-called liberals, and attractive candidates. But the party needs basic organization, too, and since that is the longer job, it should be first on the agenda as the National Committee meets in Des Moines in late January.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1685","A master plan, prepared by chairman Meade Alcorn and reported in the press, is to be the subject of discussion at that meeting. And rightly it stresses better organization as a major problem. This plan is in many respects excellent. It stresses the Congressional district as the basic unit for work in regaining control of the Federal government and also of State Legislatures and governorships. The Congressional district is a manageable unit, larger than the county and smaller than the state. The plan also suggests annual regional conferences devoted to the training of local people in campaign techniques and strategy.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1686","**THE UNIONS KNOW HOW**","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1687","These fundamentals are understood clearly by many people in the Democratic Party, especially the politically minded leaders of the labor unions. Twenty years ago, these union leaders realized that behind the facade of a very popular President the party units were hollow shells. Hence, those leaders moved in with money, manpower, and highly skilled political methods of getting out the vote and took over in many districts and states. They began at the level of the precinct—the city block, the apartment house, and the shop. Their agents were professional in two senses. They were paid, year-round employees of the unions themselves or, in the case of shop stewards, of management. They were also expertly trained in the down-to-earth practice of union politics. While there should be more enforcement of the laws regarding the use of union funds, their power has amply been demonstrated by the number of political unknowns and greenhorns whom they elected to the 86th Congress. The Republican Party need not adopt their legislative objectives, as some “liberal” Republicans suggest, but the party might learn from their technique.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1688","**BUILD FROM BOTTOM UP**","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1689","In the Republican Party, however, there are two factors which complicate the problem. It cannot commandeer the services of workers, generally. Volunteers must constitute the main reliance in campaigns. And the Republican Party is composed of many parts. There are the National Committee and the two campaign committees in the houses of Congress at the top. These have no direct authority over the countless local and state Republican organizations. Hence, there must be a clear distinction as to the functions of the local and state parties and the national organizations. The Alcorn program fails, it seems to me, to emphasize this distinction. The Republican Party can never regain its strength except as it is built from the bottom. The National Committee may suggest and to a degree help. It cannot impose its will upon the states and localities. And Alcorn’s suggestion of a group of 40 roving experts to go into states and work is impracticable and dangerous. For it may not be realized in Washington yet, but there is a strong feeling in the states and Congressional districts that they must work out their own salvation.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"
"1690","An earlier suggestion of mine, made in this space shortly after the election, is essential. That is the employment in 50 to 100 Congressional districts of paid, year-round managers, financed by the people in the districts and responsible to the party organizations there. The National Committee might well set up an institute or school to train these professionals and also give publicity to party principles through pronouncements of the President and Vice President. So far as recruiting candidates and directing local activities are concerned, its function should be purely advisory. This is a workable formula for success in 1960.","1959-01-26",1959,1,26,"moley_perspective_AI_75.txt"

"1718","TOKYO—The most frequent question I have encountered in nearly three weeks in Japan is whether the United States is contemplating the recognition of Red China. This lies heavily on the minds of political and business leaders. Radical elements devoutly hope for it. Responsible people who see the perils involved fear it. If the United States should recognize Red China, Japan would of necessity follow suit. The consequence would be the loss of vast Southeastern Asia to the free world. Before long, the Communist frontier would reach to Australia, Hawaii, and our Pacific Coast. A friendly Japan would be exposed or absorbed.","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"

"1720","One source of rumors about recognition are the Communists. But it has been given specific but false authority by a Japanese politician of some prominence. His story, widely spread, is embellished by the use of the names of two prominent American civilians who presumably have influence with the American Government.","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"
"1721","My reply to questions is that no responsible leader in either American party has or will advocate recognition. For to do so would ignite bitter indignation among the American people.","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"
"1722","**THE MORAL ELEMENT**","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"
"1723","I have also explained that our policy of recognition has greatly changed since President Woodrow Wilson broke precedent in refusing recognition to a Mexican dictator and later to Soviet Russia. In earlier years, we followed the international custom of recognizing any country which had measurable stability. The Wilson doctrine brought the moral element into recognition.","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"
"1724","In present American policy are several new elements. We are a member of the United Nations, pledged by its charter against aggression as a national policy, a policy persistently followed by the Peking government. Moreover, our people bear the bitter memory of thousands of Americans killed by Chinese intervention in the Korean war. And we have a profound obligation to Formosa, which in our obligation to Formosa, which in our obligation to Formosa, which in our left Japan’s peril from Communism is both external and internal. It lies close to the overwhelming powers of Red China and Soviet Russia and has no significant military strength to protect itself. They would certainly make trouble for a capitalist Japan.

It is far from adequate. During the occupation, SCAP required the complete decentralization and reorganization of the efficient system that prevailed before the Pacific war. This went so far that Japan’s capacity to maintain order was drastically weakened. Only the presence of American military power assured security.","1959-04-20",1959,4,20,"moley_perspective_AI_78.txt"

Consider the unfolding picture of public housing, slum clearance, and urban renewal in which windfalls are created for promoters, political lawyers and bankers, investors, contractors, and others. Or note that the chief beneficiaries of the soil bank are large corporations whose major profit is not in selling the product of their thousands of acres, but in government benefits. Many other avenues to riches might be cited for a few individuals and organizations who certainly are not ""needy"" or ""little""—all in the name of general welfare.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_86.txt"
"1738","The Humphrey-Price bill, which failed to pass over the President's veto, would have taken the Rural Electrification Administration away from the watchful eye of a fine public servant, Secretary Benson. The Washington lobby for rural electrification, many members of Congress, and zealots for a government power monopoly want to push ""rural"" electrification beyond the remote farmers, who are now supplied, to the suburbs and the cities. This would be deadly competition with investor-owned companies because the government is lending money to the rural electrical cooperatives at 2 per cent—half or less what the government must pay for it.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_86.txt"

"1740","No one questions the validity of the original purpose of the REA, nor the wholesome character of most of the 900 cooperatives. Most of them are content with sticking to their field with modest returns. But since they are associated in a sort of trade association-pressure lobby called the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, they are being led collectively into a vast scheme which promises illimitable profits not in the production and sale of electricity but in banking and investment. That is, so long as the present 2 per cent rate of borrowing from the government and tax-free status can be retained.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_86.txt"
"1741","The head of the NRECA, Clyde C. Ellis, is a man of vast imagination coupled with incredible political influence. At the last meeting of his organization he unfolded the plan. It involves the brimming financial position of the cooperatives. The latest reports show a spectacular growth in their ""investments and savings"" account. In 1953 this was $43.7 million, in 1957 it was $192 million. The total earned surplus rose from $153 million in 1953 to $382 million in 1957.","1959-07-06",1959,7,6,"moley_perspective_AI_86.txt"
"1742","Ellis proposed that the investment account be put into his NRECA in trusteeship—an unusual function for a trade association-pressure organization.

"1997","Now, seven weeks after witnessing the rout of the Labor Party in Britain and after visiting three other countries in Europe, it is time to appraise the political revolution which seems to be quietly moving over our Western allies. It is the ascendency of experience over experimentation, the realization of the possible over prophecy, things over ideology, and fact over fancy.

"1999","Most important to us as we approach another election is the plight of the British Labor Party. As Lord Woolton says in his recently published memoirs, the adoption of the name ""Labor Party"" by the Socialists was an inspiration. But now the name is a millstone because it suggests the idea of a class party. And class distinctions are becoming less important over there by the day. There are the poor and needy, but they are no longer identical with the workers. Nationalization has no appeal. Thus, the two tenets of Socialism, the class struggle and government ownership, fade into the past, leaving Hugh Gaitskell and his more practical colleagues with a party without an issue.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_89.txt"

For in the election of 1950 a fat majority of 186 in the House of Commons was reduced to a little more than a dozen. Labor's great sweep in 1945 was a wholly abnormal manifestation of weariness, impatience, and near-despair by a nation eviscerated by a long war.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_89.txt"
"2002","At the forthcoming conference of the Labor Party there will be underlined the internal malaise with which it is afflicted. The creators of the party and its component elements have always been an ill-assorted lot.

"2005","Within the present parliamentary minority there are men, like Gaitskell, who would like to fulfill a function similar to that of the Liberals of the past. But the composition and support of the party frustrates this ideal. For the party has its share of zealots still intent upon Marxist goals. Moreover, it must depend for finances upon the trade unions, which are concerned with more immediate practical advantages. Compromise must be sought at every turn—impossible compromises considering the composition of the party following. As someone wrote during the campaign, Gaitskell is at a loss as to whether he is the head of a responsible party suited to govern, or the high priest of a reform movement. This is his dilemma. Unless it can be resolved, his party may die. Surely it can never regain power in its present state.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_89.txt"
"2006","During the campaign Gaitskell followed a line known to Americans through Democrats like the Humphreys and Republicans like the Rockefellers and Javitses. It promises lower taxes and high spending, to be paid for out of a hypothetical increase in the rate of production. The British refused the gamble. Americans, if they are wise, should also reject such economic illusions.","1959-11-30",1959,11,30,"moley_perspective_AI_89.txt"

This expectation of a brave new order was blighted by war in 1914. Then, just before World War II, the prospect of stabilizing reform and the denial of a third term was promising. But the imminence of war assured another Roosevelt term. Thus, all calculations for the 1960s must be limited by the possibility of war or its imminence.

It is not especially relevant to note that on the issues which created their opposition—namely, the American colonies and Ireland—Burke was proved to be magnificently correct. More relevant it is that in a speech he made before the election he said that, while the member owed much to his constituents, he must put the national interest over their selfish interests, and that only through strong national parties could freedom be sustained. These two principles are definitely established in British politics.

Next, I journeyed to the constituency of Chippenham, which stretches 25 miles from east to west and contains two or three fair-size towns and a most attractive countryside.","1955-05-30",1955,5,30,"moley_perspective_AI_93.txt"

He is responsible not strictly to the member from Chippenham, but to the head office of the party in London. During the campaign he has five or six paid employees, but most of his department heads and a great many workers are volunteers. Everything is governed by written orders from Mellsop. His area of operation comprises 90 voting districts, and he must create and energize a committee with a chairman and volunteer workers in each. These distribute and mail party literature, but their most important task is the canvass, the basic element in an election campaign. Workers carry with them lists of the qualified voters and after an interview register thereon the preference of the voter. Early in the campaign, those who will need to vote by mail are identified. If they are Conservative, it is the job of the agent to see that they file the necessary paper for a ballot. On election day the Mellsop organization must see to it that every Conservative in the constituency votes. Mellsop must also schedule six or eight daily appearances of his candidate at designated spots and an equal number for the candidate's wife. The Chippenham member is Sir David Eccles, Minister of Education. The brigadier only has $2,400 to spend in the campaign.","1955-05-30",1955,5,30,"moley_perspective_AI_93.txt"

Their employees are few and poorly paid. At least 80 per cent of the money necessary to run the Labor Party comes from the unions. The sums collected from union members are miserably small. And the difficulty of recruiting party members outside the unions is shown by the fact that while 140,000 votes were cast here in 1951 for Labor candidates, there are only 8,000 additional party members.

Its high efficiency has been kept up since. It is based on the fact that elections are won in many local areas, not on a mythical national level.
